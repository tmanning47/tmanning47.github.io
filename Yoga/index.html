id="h.g1fqr5vj0hvq"><span class="c17 c7"><br>Introduction</span></h1><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">During a study trip to the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore in 1996, I asked the Ashtanga master K. Pattabhi Jois about the relevance of different scriptures for the Ashtanga Vinyasa method. With the words &ldquo;This is Patanjali Yoga,&rdquo; he pointed out that the text of prime importance for this school was the Yoga Sutra compiled by the ancient seer Patanjali. He said it was a difficult text, and only sincere study could lead to an understanding. He urged me to undertake daily study of the Yoga Sutra for a long time. The combination of these studies with daily Ashtanga Vinyasa practice led me eventually to realize that the Yoga Sutra and the vinyasa method are really only two sides of the same coin.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">That is the central theme of this book. For yoga practice to be successful, there can be no separation of practice and philosophy. Indeed, new approaches to practice have always come out of philosophy, while practice prepares the intellect for philosophy. In fact the Yoga Sutra suggests that philosophical inquiry &mdash; svadhyaya, or vichara as Shankara calls it &mdash; is itself a form of practice, and an essential ingredient of the path to freedom.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This book is dedicated to bringing the two aspects back together and restoring what historically was one system, lost through the lapse of time.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.4fa9ey8lo53c"><span class="c25 c3">The Rediscovery of the Ashtanga Vinyasa System</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The notion that the Yoga Sutra and the vinyasa system are two sides of one coin has been strongly present from the beginning of the modern-day Ashtanga Yoga lineage. K. Pattabhi Jois received the vinyasa method from his master, T. Krishnamacharya; Krishnamacharya&rsquo;s own master, Ramamohan Brahmachary, instructed him to seek out what was understood to be the last remaining copy of an elusive scripture, the Yoga Korunta, thought to have been compiled by the ancient seer Vamana.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">According to Krishnamacharya&rsquo;s biography, the Yoga Korunta contained not only the vinyasa system but also the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali and its commentary, Yoga Bhasya, compiled by the Rishi Vyasa. These were bound together in one volume. We can see from this that, in ancient times, what are today regarded as two systems that only share the same name &mdash; the Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali and the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga of the Rishi Vamana &mdash; were in fact one.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">We see here also the idea that yogic philosophy is taught together with the practice. The practice of asana (posture) alone poses a danger. According to K. Pattabhi Jois, &ldquo;Partial yoga methods out of line with their internal purpose can build up the &lsquo;six enemies&rsquo; (desire, anger, greed, illusion, infatuation, and envy) around the heart. The full Ashtanga system practised with devotion leads to freedom within one&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Today, however, we are in the situation where on the one hand there are scholars who try to understand the Yoga Sutra without knowing its practices, while on the other hand there are many Ashtanga Vinyasa practitioners who are established in practice but do not know the philosophy of their system. Both aspects practiced together will make practice easy, because we know where it leads and how we get there. Without dedicated practice, philosophy can turn into mere theory. Once established in practice, we will swiftly internalize the philosophy and attain higher yoga.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.kjer4o2g48v3"><span class="c25 c3">The Relevance of Ashtanga Yoga Today</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">I do not claim here that Vinyasa Yoga is the only form of Patanjali Yoga. That would be absurd. It is, however, one of the authentic representations of Patanjali&rsquo;s sutra that is still alive.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This system is precious &mdash; and relevant &mdash; today because it was conceived by the ancient seer Vamana, the author of the Yoga Korunta, especially for householders (grihasta). A householder is somebody who has a job and family, and lives and works in society, as opposed to a monk, hermit, or ascetic (sannyasi). Some forms of yoga are designed for hermits who have no social responsibility and therefore can be engaged with meditation techniques all day long.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Being a hermit or ascetic, however, was never a requirement for yoga. As the Bhagavad Gita explains, &ldquo;One who outwardly performs his social duties but inwardly stays free is a yogi.&rdquo;3 If everybody ceased performing their social responsibilities, the text continues,4 this world would be ruined, for obvious reasons. So we need not be disturbed if responsibility for others keeps us from devoting more time to our practice, since fulfilling one&rsquo;s duty is practice. But what is important is how we practice. How do we spend the precious time we can allocate to practicing?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">When T. Krishnamacharya had completed his training, his master, R. Brahmachary, proposed to him that he should get married, have a family, and teach yoga to city dwellers. This came as a surprise to the younger man: being so highly trained, he could have become a great scholar or the abbot of a monastery. But as a teacher of yoga to city dwellers he would have very low social status.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Brahmachary told Krishnamacharya to study the Yoga Korunta, as he knew this would equip him best for teaching householders. The Vinyasa Yoga described in that text was the ideal form of Patanjali Yoga for householders, since it required only around two hours of practice per day.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.aanthpc9q0f9"><span class="c25 c3">The Eight Limbs of Yoga, and How They Work Together</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">According to Patanjali there are eight &ldquo;limbs&rdquo; of yoga. How they work together can be understood from the following story:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Once upon a time a couple lived happily together in a country that had an unjust king. The king became jealous of their happiness and threw the man into a prison tower. When his wife came to the tower at night to comfort him, the man called down to her that she should return the next night with a long silken thread, a strong thread, a cord, a rope, a beetle, and some honey. Although puzzled by the request, the wife returned the next evening with all the items. Her husband then asked her to tie the silken thread to the beetle and smear honey onto its antennae. She should then place the beetle on the tower wall with its head facing upward. Smelling the honey, the beetle started to climb up the tower in expectation of finding more of it, dragging the silken thread as it did so. When it reached the top of the tower the man took hold of the silken thread and called down to his wife that she should tie the strong thread to the other end. Pulling the strong thread up, he secured it also and instructed her further to tie the cord to the other end. Once he had the cord the rest happened quickly. With the rope attached to the cord he pulled it up, secured one end of it and, climbing down, escaped to freedom.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The couple are, of course, yogis. The prison tower represents conditioned existence. The silken thread symbolizes the purifying of the body through asana. The strong thread represents pranayama, breath extension, the cord symbolizes meditation, and the rope stands for samadhi, the state of pure being. Once this rope is held, freedom from conditioned existence is possible.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Patanjali&rsquo;s eight limbs of yoga relate to Ashtanga Vinyasa practice thus:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The first limb consists of a set of ethics, which ensures that the yogi interacts in a harmonious way with the surrounding community. The ethical precepts are: not to harm others, to be truthful, not to steal, to engage in intercourse only with one&rsquo;s partner, and to abstain from greed.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The second limb consists of observances, which ensure that body and mind are not polluted once they have been purified. Purification in yoga has nothing to do with puritanism. Rather it refers to the &ldquo;stainability&rdquo; of body and mind. &ldquo;Stainability&rdquo; is the propensity of the body/mind to take on a conditioning or imprint from the environment. The observances are physical and mental cleanliness, contentment, simplicity, study of sacred texts, and acceptance of the existence of the Supreme Being. The first two limbs are initially implemented from the outside, and they form a platform from which practice is undertaken. Once we are established in yoga they become our second nature: they will arise naturally.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The third limb is asana. Many obstacles to knowing one&rsquo;s true nature are manifested in the body, for example disease, sluggishness, and dullness. The body profoundly influences and, if in bad condition, impinges on the functioning of mind and intellect. Through the practice of yoga asanas the body is made &ldquo;strong and light like the body of a lion,&rdquo; to quote Shri K. Pattabhi Jois. Only then will it provide the ideal vehicle on the path of yoga.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">As the Yoga Sutra explains,5 every thought, emotion, and experience leaves a subconscious imprint (samskara) in the mind. These imprints determine who we will be in the future. According to theBrhad Aranyaka Upanishad, as long as liberation is not achieved, the soul, like a caterpillar that draws itself from one blade of grass over to the next, will, by the force of its impressions in this life, reach out and draw itself over to a new body in a new life.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This means that the body we have today is nothing but the accumulation of our past thoughts, emotions, and actions. In fact our body is the crystallized history of our past thoughts. This needs to be deeply understood and contemplated. It means that asana is the method that releases us from past conditioning, stored in the body, to arrive in the present moment. It is to be noted that practicing forcefully will only superimpose a new layer of subconscious imprints based on suffering and pain. It will also increase identification with the body. In yoga, identification with anything that is impermanent is called ignorance (avidya).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This may sound rather abstract at first, but all of us who have seen a loved one die will remember the profound insight that, once death has set in, the body looks just like an empty shell left behind. Since the body is our vehicle and the storehouse of our past, we want to practice asana to the point where it serves us well, while releasing and letting go of the past that is stored in it.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Yoga is the middle path between two extremes. On the one hand, we can go to the extreme of practicing fanatically and striving for an ideal while denying the reality of this present moment. The problem with this is that we are only ever relating to ourselves as what we want to become in the future and not as what we are right now. The other extreme is advocated by some schools of psychotherapy that focus on highlighting past traumas. If we do this, these traumas can increase their grip on us, and we relate to ourselves as we have in the past, defining ourselves by the &ldquo;stuff that&rsquo;s coming up&rdquo; and the &ldquo;process that we are going through.&rdquo; Asana is an invitation to say goodbye to these extremes and arrive at the truth of the present moment.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">How do past emotions, thoughts, and impressions manifest in the body? Some students of yoga experience a lot of anger on commencing forward bending. This is due to past anger having been stored in the hamstrings. If we consciously let go of the anger, the emotion will disappear. If not, it will surface in some other form, possibly as an act of aggression or as a chronic disease. Other students feel like crying after intense backbending. Emotional pain is stored in the chest, where it functions like armor, hardening around the heart. This armor may be dissolved in backbending. If we let go of the armor, a feeling of tremendous relief will result, sometimes accompanied by crying.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Extreme stiffness can be related to mental rigidity or the inability to let oneself be transported into unknown situations. Extreme flexibility, on the other hand, can be related to the inability to take a position in life and to set boundaries. In this case, asana practice needs to be more strength based, to create a balance and to learn to resist being stretched to inappropriate places. Asana invites us to acknowledge the past and let it go. This will in turn bring us into the present moment and allow us to let go of limiting concepts such as who we think we are.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The fourth limb is pranayama. Prana is the life force, also referred to as the inner breath; pranayama means extension of prana. The yogis discovered that the pulsating or oscillating of prana happens simultaneously with the movements of the mind (chitta vrtti). The practice of pranayama is the study and exercise of one&rsquo;s breath to a point where it is appeased and does not agitate the mind.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In the vinyasa system, pranayama is practiced through applying the Ujjayi breath. By slightly constricting the glottis, the breath is stretched long. We learn to let the movement follow the breath, which eventually leads to the body effortlessly riding the waves of the breath. At this point it is not we who move the body, but rather the power of prana. We become able to breathe into all parts of the body, which is equivalent to spreading the prana evenly throughout. This is ayama &mdash; the extension of the breath.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The fifth limb is pratyahara &mdash; sense withdrawal. The Maitri Upanishad says that, if one becomes preoccupied with sense objects, the mind is fueled, which will lead to delusion and suffering.6 If, however, the fuel of the senses is withheld, then, like a fire that dies down without fuel, the mind becomes reabsorbed into its source, the heart. &ldquo;Heart&rdquo; in yoga is a metaphor not for emotions but for our center, which is consciousness or the self.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In Vinyasa Yoga, sense withdrawal is practiced through drishti &mdash; focal point. Instead of looking around while practicing asana, which leads to the senses reaching out, we stay internal by turning our gaze toward prescribed locations. The sense of hearing is drawn in by listening to the sound of the breath, which at the same time gives us feedback about the quality of the asana. By keeping our attention from reaching out, we develop what tantric philosophy calls the center (madhya). By developing the center, the mind is eventually suspended and the prana, which is a manifestation of the female aspect of creation, the Goddess or Shakti, ceases to oscillate. Then the state of divine consciousness (bhairava) is recognized.7</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The sixth limb is dharana &mdash; concentration. If you have tried to meditate on the empty space between two thoughts, you will know that the mind has the tendency to attach itself to the next thought arising. Since all objects have form, and the witnessing subject &mdash; the consciousness &mdash; is formless, it tends to be overlooked by the mind. It takes a great deal of focus to keep watching consciousness when distractions are available.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The practice of concentration, then, is a prerequisite and preparation for meditation proper. The training of concentration enables us to stay focused on whatever object is chosen. First, simple objects are selected, which in turn prepare us for the penultimate &ldquo;object,&rdquo; formless consciousness, which is nothing but pure awareness.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Concentration in Vinyasa Yoga is practiced by focusing on the bandhas. On an external level the focus is on Mula and Uddiyana Bandha (pelvic and lower abdominal locks), but on an internal level it is on the bonding together of movement, breath, and awareness (bandha = bonding). To achieve this bonding, we have to let go of the beta brain-wave pattern, which normally accompanies concentration. Instead we need to shift to an alpha pattern, which enables multiple focus and leads into simultaneous awareness of everything, or being in this moment, which is meditation.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The seventh limb is dhyana &mdash; meditation. Meditation means to rest, uninfluenced, between the extremes of the mind and suddenly just &ldquo;be&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo; The difference between this and the previous limb is that, in concentration, there is a conscious effort to exclude all thoughts that are not relevant to our chosen object. In meditation there is a constant flow of impressions from the object and of awareness toward the object, without any effort of the will. Typical objects chosen are the heart lotus, the inner sound, the breath, the sense-of-I, the process of perception, and intellect, one&rsquo;s meditation deity (ishtadevata) or the Supreme Being.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In Vinyasa Yoga, meditation starts when, rather than doing the practice, we are being done or moved. At this point we realize that, since we can watch the body, we are not the body but a deeper-lying witnessing entity. The vinyasa practice is the constant coming and going of postures, the constant change of form, which we never hold on to. It is itself a meditation on impermanence. When we come to the point of realizing that everything we have known so far &mdash; the world, the body, the mind, and the practice &mdash; is subject to constant change, we have arrived at meditation on intelligence (buddhi).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Meditation does not, however, occur only in dhyana, but in all stages of the practice. In fact the Ashtanga Vinyasa system is a movement meditation. First we meditate on the position of the body in space, which is asana. Then we meditate on the life force moving the body, which is pranayama. The next stage is to meditate on the senses through drishti and listening to the breath, which ispratyahara. Meditating on the binding together of all aspects of the practice is concentration (dharana).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The eighth limb, samadhi, is of two kinds &mdash; objective and objectless. Objective samadhi is when the mind for the first time, like a clear jewel, reflects faithfully what it is directed at and does not just produce another simulation of reality.8 In other words the mind is clarified to an extent that it does not modify sensory input at all. To experience this, we have to &ldquo;de-condition&rdquo; ourselves to the extent that we let go of all limiting and negative programs of the past. Patanjali says, &ldquo;Memory is purified, as if emptied of its own form.&rdquo;9 Then all that can be known about an object is known.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Objectless samadhi is the highest form of yoga. It does not depend on an object for its arising but, rather, the witnessing subject or awareness, which is our true nature, is revealed. In this samadhi the thought waves are suspended, which leads to knowing of that which was always there: consciousness or the divine self. This final state is beyond achieving, beyond doing, beyond practicing. It is a state of pure ecstatic being described by the term kaivalya &mdash; a state in which there is total freedom and independence from any external stimulation whatsoever.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In the physical disciplines of yoga, samadhi is reached by suspending the extremes of solar (pingala) and lunar (ida) mind. This state arises when the inner breath (prana) enters the central channel (sushumna). Then truth or deep reality suddenly flashes forth.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.f1hipk76sum1"><span class="c25 c3">Why a Traditional Practice is Still Applicable</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>A peasant once spoke to the sage Ramakrishna thus: &ldquo;I am a simple villager. Please give me in one sentence a method by which I can obtain happiness.&rdquo; Ramakrishna&rsquo;s answer was: </span><span class="c10">&ldquo;Totally accept the fact that you are a machine operated upon by God.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c3">This needs to be deeply understood. It is through the belief that individuals exercise free will that ego is produced; and, in turn, ego produces suffering. In the Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna states, &ldquo;All actions are done in all cases by the gunas (qualities) of prakrti (nature). He whose mind is deluded through egoism thinks I am the doer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This means that the entire cosmos, including our body-mind complex, is an unconscious machine operated upon by God. Our self, who is pure consciousness, is forever inactive. It merely witnesses. The giving up of the idea that it is we who act is echoed in the Yoga Sutra by Patanjali&rsquo;s use of the term kaivalya. This final state of yoga is the realization of the complete independence of consciousness. Since it is completely independent, it has no way of influencing the world. Like a mirror, which simply reflects, consciousness can neither reject nor hold on to objects of its choice. Give up the sense of agency, says Krishna: &ldquo;Only a fool believes I am the doer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>The surrender of the illusion of free will is reflected in the vinyasa system by acceptance of the original system as expounded by the Rishi Vamana. Of course it is easy to make up our own sequences of asanas, and possibly commercial success and fame will result. But then we run the risk of falling for the ego, which says I am the doer and the creator. </span><span class="c10">We are only pure consciousness &mdash; the seer, the witness, the self </span><span>&mdash; which, as the Samkhya Karika says, </span><span>plays no active part in this world</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>That does not mean we cannot adapt the practice for some time if difficulties are to be met or yoga therapy needs to be practiced. We need to return to the original system whenever possible, though. </span><span class="c10">Rishi Vamana&rsquo;s system leads through outer structure and limitation to inner freedom</span><span class="c0 c3">. If we constantly practice self-made sequences, we create inner limitation through outer freedom.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>The rishis of old did not conceive the ancient arts and sciences by trial and error. The method they employed was</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;samyama</span><span>, which combines </span><span class="c10">concentration (dharana)</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">meditation (dhyana)</span><span>, and </span><span class="c10">absorption (samadhi)</span><span>. In that way, deep knowledge of how things really are can be gained. Patanjali himself explains in the Yoga Sutra how he gained his knowledge. </span><span class="c10">Knowledge of the mind</span><span>, he says, </span><span class="c3 c16 c10">is gained by doing samyama on the heart.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>He also explains how the body can be understood. </span><span class="c10">Medical knowledge</span><span>, he says,</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;is gained by practicing samyama on the navel chakra</span><span class="c0 c3">. This is how the science of Ayurveda came into being. It should be noted that Patanjali compiled the Charaka Samhita, an ayurvedic text. When we study and practice the ancient sciences today, we need to do this with a feeling of respect and devotion.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>The teachings of the ancient masters have never been declared invalid. They have only ever been added to.</span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.3ytf6hyj2pqp"><span class="c25 c3">Breath</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The most visible aspect of the Ashtanga Yoga system is the different yoga asanas (postures). More important, though, is the invisible content, which consists of three fundamental techniques. These techniques bind the postures together on a string so that they become a yoga mala or garland.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>In the Vinyasa Yoga system </span><span class="c10">the body is used as a mantra</span><span>, the postures represent beads, and the three fundamental techniques </span><span>form</span><span>&nbsp;the string that holds the beads together to create a garland of yoga postures. The system is designed to work as a</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;movement meditation</span><span>, where the</span><span class="c3 c16 c10">&nbsp;transitions from each posture to the next are as important as the postures themselves.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>For the beginner it is essential to learn these three fundamental techniques at the outset. Once they are mastered, the practice will happen almost effortlessly. Without them it can become hard work. The three techniques are </span><span class="c10">Ujjayi pranayama, Mula Bandha, and Uddiyana Bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">. We now focus on the first of these.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c10">Ujjayi pranayama</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;means &ldquo;victorious breath&rdquo; or the victorious stretching of the breath. The term pranayama is a combination of two words, prana and ayama. Ayama means extending or stretching, while prana can have several meanings. It is usually taken to mean inner breath or life force, and as such it makes up part of the subtle anatomy of the body. Other elements of the subtle anatomy are nadis (energy channels) and chakras (energy centers). Sometimes, however, prana is used to refer to the outer or anatomical breath. In this context pranayama means extension of breath: the adoption of a calm, peaceful, and steady breathing pattern. When the breath is calm, the mind is also calm.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c10">Ujjayi </span><span>pranayama</span><span>&nbsp;is a process of </span><span class="c10">stretching the breath</span><span>, and in this way extending the life force. Practicing it requires a slight constriction of the glottis &mdash; the upper opening of the larynx &mdash; by partially closing it with the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a lid on the throat that is closed when we drink water and open when we breathe. By half closing the epiglottis we stretch the breath and create a </span><span class="c10">gentle hissing</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">sound</span><span>, which we listen to throughout the entire practice. The sound produced seemingly comes from the center of the chest and not from the throat. The vocal cords are not engaged, as that would lead to strain: </span><span class="c10">any humming that accompanies a sound like wind in the trees or waves on the shore should be eradicated</span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Guide: </span><span class="c30"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DIQrsJ-yZWV8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1723525227866833&amp;usg=AOvVaw0xirsreC8L2kvyutxjNZp3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQrsJ-yZWV8</a></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Listening to the sound of your own breath has several implications. First and foremost it is a pratyahara technique. Pratyahara, the fifth limb of yoga, means &ldquo;withdrawing the senses from the outer world&rdquo; or, more simply, &ldquo;going inside.&rdquo; This will be considered in detail later. For now it will suffice to say that listening to your own breath draws your attention inward and takes it away from external sounds. This is a meditation aid.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>Furthermore the sound of the breath can teach us almost everything we need to learn about our attitude in the posture. </span><span class="c3 c16 c10">At times the breath may sound strained, labored, short, aggressive, flat, shallow, or fast. By bringing it back to the ideal of a smooth, pleasant sound we begin to correct any negative or unhelpful attitudes.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>To practice </span><span class="c10">Ujjayi, sit in an upright but comfortable position.</span><span>&nbsp;Start producing the Ujjayi sound steadily, with no breaks between breaths. Give the sound an even quality throughout the entire length of the breath, both inhaling and exhaling. Lengthen each breath and deepen it. </span><span class="c10">Breathe evenly into the rib cage</span><span class="c0 c3">. Breathe simultaneously into the sides, the front, the back, and finally into the upper lobes of the lungs. The rib cage needs to have a gentle pulsating movement, which means the internal intercostals (the muscles between the ribs) relax on inhalation, allowing the rib cage to expand freely as we breathe.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Our culture tends to focus only on abdominal breathing, which leads not only to a slouching posture but also to rigidity of the rib cage. This is due to the intercostal muscles lacking exercise, which in turn blocks the flow of blood and life force in the thorax and opens the way to coronary disease and cardiopulmonary weakness. The slouching appearance in this area is due to a relaxation of the rectus abdominis muscle, commonly known as &ldquo;the abs.&rdquo; This slouching makes the belly soft and promotes abdominal breathing.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Furthermore this relaxation of the rectus abdominis allows the pubic bone to drop, leading to an anterior (forward) tilt of the pelvis, which produces a hyperlordotic low back, commonly referred to as a sway back. This in turn lifts the origin of the erector spinae, the main back extensor muscle. Thus shortened, the erector spinae loses its effectiveness in lifting the chest. The chest collapses, leading not only to a slouching appearance but also to a rigid, hard rib cage. This prevents the thoracic organs from getting massaged during breathing. The lack of massage and movement of heart and lungs lowers their resistance to disease. The compensatory pattern, leading to a sway back, an anteriorly tilted pelvis, and a collapsed chest, is one of the worst postural imbalances, and its main cause is favoring abdominal breathing and the resulting weakness of the abdominals.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>In yoga we use both the abdomen and the thorax to breathe. The intercostals are exercised through actively breathing. The air is literally pumped out of the lungs until all that remains is the respiratory rest volume, the amount of air left after a full exhalation. The aim is to breathe more deeply so as to in crease vitality. </span><span class="c3 c16 c10">The way to achieve this is not by inhaling as much as possible but by first exhaling completely in order to create space for the new inhalation.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">There are two vital reasons for wanting to increase breath volume. First, by increasing our inhalation we increase the amount of oxygen supplied. Second, by increasing our exhalation we exhale more toxins.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">These toxins fall into several categories:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Mental toxins &mdash; examples include the thought of conflict toward another being or collective conflict like the wish to go to war with another nation for whatever reason.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Emotional toxins &mdash; fear, anger, hatred, jealousy, attachment to suffering, and the like.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Physical toxins &mdash; metabolic waste products that are not being excreted.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Environmental toxins &mdash; lead, nicotine, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, recreational drugs, and the like.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">All of these toxins have a tendency to be held and stored in the body in &ldquo;stale,&rdquo; &ldquo;dead&rdquo; areas where there is only a small amount of oxygen, often around the joints or in adipose tissue (fat). The buildup of these toxins &mdash; a literal energetic dying of certain body areas long before the death of the entire organism &mdash; can eventually lead to chronic disease. In fact the buildup of toxins and the simultaneous depletion of oxygen in certain tissues is the number-one cause of chronic disease.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">By breathing deeply, exhaling accumulated toxins and inhaling oxygen, we take the first steps toward returning the body to its original state of health. More steps are required, and these will be covered later. Briefly they are storing energy (in the section that follows on bandhas) and awakening the whole body.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>The </span><span class="c10">main reason for practicing Ujjayi </span><span>pranayama is not, however, for its physical benefits, but rather in order </span><span class="c10">to still the mind</span><span class="c0 c3">. Why should the mind be stilled? Yoga Sutra I.2 states, &ldquo;Yoga is the stilling of the fluctuations of the mind.&rdquo; Sutra I.3 says, &ldquo;Only then when the mind is still abides the seer in its true nature.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The mind can be likened to a lake. If thought waves (vrtti) appear, the surface of the lake is disturbed and ripples appear. Looking into the water you can see only a distorted representation of your appearance. This distortion is what we constantly see, and it is the reason we don&rsquo;t know our true selves. This leads to suffering (duhkha) and ignorance (avidya).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">When the thought waves have subsided and the surface of the lake of the mind becomes still for the first time, we can see who we really are. The mind is completely clear and, as a result, we can achieve identity with the object it is directed at. The notion of stilling the fluctuations of the mind is often referred to as the arresting of the mind or mind control in yogic literature. The term &ldquo;mind control&rdquo; is misleading and unfortunate, however. It was rigorously criticized by sages like Ramana Maharshi, who said that if you want to control the mind you need a second mind to control the first one, and a third to control the second. Aside from this infinite regression, having separate parts of your mind struggle for control over each other can lead to schizophrenia. In less extreme cases it can lead to becoming a &ldquo;control freak,&rdquo; which makes for being a thoroughly unhappy person.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Ancient yogis found a solution to this problem when they realized that thinking (vrtti) and movement of life force (prana) happen together. According to the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, &ldquo;Both the mind and the breath are united together like milk and water and both of them are equal in their activities. The mind begins its activities where there is the breath, and the prana begins its activities where there is the mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">We know now that mind and breath move together. Influencing the mind directly is regarded as difficult, but through directing the breath it can be achieved much more easily. The extension of the breath through the practice of Ujjayi pranayama smooths the flow of prana.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>It is important to always </span><span class="c10">breathe through the nose only</span><span class="c0 c3">. If we breathe through the mouth, heat and energy will be lost. It will also dry us out too much. According to Indian tradition, if the mouth is kept open demons will enter. Apparently demons become very jealous of the merit that a yogi accumulates. I will leave this view to individual evaluation.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>Remember the connection between breath and movement: every movement comes out of breath. Rather than moving with and following the breath, </span><span class="c10">the breath should initiate the movement</span><span class="c0 c3">. Practicing this way, we will be moved by the breath like the autumn wind picking up leaves.</span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.ey2wr3vwizx"><span class="c25 c3">Bandhas</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">We have learned in the previous section about the importance of deep breathing. What is it exactly that makes yogic breathing so effective?</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>To answer this we have to look again at the idea of prana. As we already know, prana can refer to the anatomical breath, but it most often denotes life force, located in the subtle body. It is important to understand that the two are not identical. However, the movements of the life force that occur in the subtle or energetic body have some correlation to the movement of breath in the gross body. The flow of prana can be influenced by directing one&rsquo;s breath. It can even be accumulated and stored. Most of us have heard accounts of yogis who managed to survive without oxygen for extended periods of time. Although it is not the purpose of yoga to perform such feats, it is nevertheless possible using a set of exercises called </span><span class="c10">mudras, mudra meaning &ldquo;seal.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;They are a combination of posture, breath, andbandha, and they produce the sealing of prana. It is this process of gaining control of the life force that differentiates yogic exercise from mere gymnastics. Gymnastics and sport can make one fit, but they don&rsquo;t have the </span><span class="c10">energy-preserving effect of yoga</span><span class="c0 c3">, because they do not use mudra and bandha. It is the combination of posture with pranayama and bandha that makes yoga so effective.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>The term </span><span class="c10">bandha</span><span>&nbsp;is related to the English word </span><span class="c10">&ldquo;bonding.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">We bond breath, movement, and awareness together.</span><span>&nbsp;The first bandha is called </span><span class="c10">Mula Bandha</span><span>, which translates as </span><span class="c10">&ldquo;root lock.&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;The root referred to here is the root of the spine, the pelvic floor or, more precisely, the center of the pelvic floor, the perineum. The perineum is the muscular body between the anus and the genitals. By slightly contracting the pubo-coccygeal (PC) muscle, which goes from the pubic bone to the tailbone (coccyx), </span><span class="c10">we create an energetic seal that locks prana into the body and so prevents it from leaking out at the base of the spine.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Mula Bandha is said to move prana into the central channel, called sushumna</span><span class="c0 c3">, which is the subtle equivalent of the spine.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>Locating the PC muscle might be difficult at first. It has been suggested that one should tighten the anus, or alternatively contract the muscle that one would use to stop urination, but these indications are not entirely accurate: Mula Bandha is neither of these two muscles but located right between them. These suggestions have their value, however, offering some guidance until we become more sensitive and are able to isolate the PC muscle more precisely. </span><span class="c10">For females it is essential not to mistake Mula Bandha for a contraction of the cervix</span><span class="c0 c3">. This contraction tends to occur especially during strenuous activity. Should a woman do this on a daily basis when engaged in two hours of yoga practice, she could experience difficulty in giving birth.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c10">In the beginning we employ mainly a gross muscular lock</span><span>, which works mainly on the gross body. Through practice we shift to an energetic lock, which works more on the subtle or pranic body. When mastered, </span><span class="c10">Mula Bandha becomes exclusively mental</span><span class="c0 c3">, and works on the causal body.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>To become familiar with Mula Bandha, </span><span class="c10">sit tall and upright</span><span>&nbsp;in a comfortable position and focus on </span><span class="c10">slightly contracting the perineum</span><span class="c0 c3">, which is the center of the pelvic floor. With the exhalation, visualize the breath beginning at the nostrils and slowly reaching down through the throat, the chest, and the abdomen until it eventually hooks into the pelvic floor, which contracts slightly. As the inhalation starts, there will be an automatic reaching upward. Since we keep the breath hooked into the pelvic floor through contracting the PC muscle, we create suction and an energetic lift upward through the entire core of the body. This is Mula Bandha. With this movement the first step is taken to arrest the downward flow of life force, which increases with age and invites death, disease, and decay like the withering of a plant, and convert it into an upward flow that promotes growth and further blossoming.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>Mula Bandha is held throughout the entire breathing cycle and during the whole practice. Every posture needs to grow out of its root. This is only finally released during deep relaxation in complete surrender. The second bandha is </span><span class="c10">Uddiyana Bandha</span><span>. It is sometimes confused with Uddiyana, one of the shat karmas or six actions, also called kriyas, of Hatha Yoga. This Uddiyana is a preparation for nauli, the stomach roll. Nauli is practiced by sucking the entire abdominal content up into the thoracic cavity. It is done only during breath retention (kumbhaka), and it is very different from the technique practiced in Vinyasa Yoga. The Uddiyana Bandha of Vinyasa Yoga is a much gentler exercise. It consists of </span><span class="c10">lightly contracting the transverse abdominis muscle</span><span>, which runs horizontally across the abdomen and is used to </span><span class="c10">draw the abdominal contents in against the spine</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>To successfully switch on Uddiyana Bandha, it is important to isolate the upper transverse abdominis muscle from the lower part and use only the part below the navel. Doing otherwise impinges on the free movement of the diaphragm. If the movement of the diaphragm is restricted for a long time, aggressive, boastful, egotistical, and macho tendencies can develop in the psyche. This is not endorsed by traditional teaching, however. Shankara and Patanjali provide us with the following explanations. </span><span class="c10">True posture, according to Shankara, is that which leads effortlessly to meditation on Brahman and not to pain and self-torture.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;Patanjali says that asana is perfected when meditation on the infinite (ananta) is achieved through the releasing of excess effort.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Some have claimed that Ashtanga Yoga is warrior yoga, and that warriors used it to psych themselves up for battle. This is a very sad misunderstanding. Those who have had a true experience of the practice will have come away feeling tired and happy &mdash; and definitely not psyched up for battle. Rather, one feels more like hugging one&rsquo;s enemy and, in complete surrender, handing them whatever they demand &mdash; perhaps even imparting genuine advice as to how to enjoy life and not waste it with such stupidities as aggression and warfare. There is no warrior yoga. War and yoga exclude each other because the first yogic commandment is ahimsa &mdash; nonviolence.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Richard Freeman says that Uddiyana Bandha is in fact only a slight suction inward just above the pubic bone. The more subtle Uddiyana Bandha becomes, the more blissful, peaceful, childlike, and innocent becomes the character of the practitioner. I suggest starting by firming the abdominal wall below the navel and then, as awareness increases with years of practice, allow Uddiyana Bandha to slide downward. Again, the more subtle it becomes, the more influence Uddiyana Bandha will have on the subtle body.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">As I have mentioned in the previous section, a lot of emphasis has been placed on abdominal breathing in our culture in the last forty years. This has its place in the performing arts &mdash; especially dance and theater &mdash; and for therapy. It is certainly helpful for singers and actors, and for someone undergoing psychotherapy. Abdominal breathing, with complete relaxation of the abdominal wall, is recommended as useful whenever we want to connect to our emotions and bring them to the fore. In the New Age movement in particular, emotions are seen as something sacred that one needs to follow and live out. Abdominal breathing is a good idea whenever one wants to intensify one&rsquo;s emotions.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In many other situations, though, it is not helpful to heighten one&rsquo;s emotions. After all, emotions are only a form of the mind. To be emotional means to react to a present situation according to a past conditioning. For example, if I am rejected in a certain situation that is new to me, I will feel hurt. If I find myself in a similar situation again, I will become emotional even before any new hurt has been inflicted. I will emote &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; before I actually feel it. An emotion is a conserved feeling that arises because the original feeling has left a subconscious imprint in the mind. Patanjali calls this imprint samskara. The theory that being emotional is being more authentic is flawed, since an emotional person is as much in the past as a person who is constantly &ldquo;in his or her head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Besides the fact that it makes one emotional, constant abdominal breathing also has negative physical repercussions. It leads to sagging, collapsing abdominal organs with enlarged, weak blood vessels and stagnant blood. Then follow a lack of oxygen supply, a decrease in vitality, and eventually the development of chronic disease.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If the lower abdominal wall is kept firm and the upper wall is relaxed, the diaphragm moves up and down freely and the whole abdomen functions like the combustion chamber of an engine, with the diaphragm as the piston. This produces a strong oscillation of intra-abdominal blood pressure, and it is exactly this mechanism that produces healthy abdominal organs. When the diaphragm moves down and the abdominal wall is held, the pressure in the combustion chamber will rise. When the diaphragm moves up, all the blood is sucked out of the abdomen and blood pressure drops. This strong oscillation of abdominal blood pressure constantly massages the internal organs and leads to strong, healthy tissue.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>We look now at the subtle mechanics of </span><span class="c10">Uddiyana Bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">. Uddiyana means flying up. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika states that, because of Uddiyana Bandha, the great bird of prana flies up incessantly through the sushumna. Sushumna is the central energy channel, which lies, albeit in the subtle body, roughly in front of the spine and originates at the perineum. It terminates within the head &mdash; some sources say at the highest point of the head, but more often it is described as ending where the head is joined to the spine. The sushumna is usually dormant. It is accompanied by two other nadis (energy channels), which wind around it like the snakes of the caduceus. These are the lunar (ida) and solar (pingala) channels. There are certain parallels between solar and lunar energy channels on the one hand and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems on the other, but we cannot say that the one is the other.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The Hatha Yoga Pradipika explains that prana should be directed into sushumna by closing the ida and pingala. The same text states that, by practicing Mula Bandha, prana will enter sushumna. In a later stanza of the text a great truth is revealed: time (which we perceive as the fluctuation of night and day) is produced by the sun and moon. In other words, it is the illusion of time that prevents us from recognizing deep reality (Brahman), which is timeless and is fabricated by the moment of inner breath (prana)in the pingala (solar) and ida (lunar) energy channels.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The stanza goes on to reveal the key to all physical yoga, which is that the sushumna devours time. In other words, if prana is made to enter the central channel it will devour time, which is itself a creation of the fluctuating mind and which keeps us from abiding in deep reality, the timeless consciousness (Brahman). Time is the operating system of the human mind; to go beyond time is to go beyond mind. This is possible when the great bird of prana flies up in sushumna, and sushumna devours time. For this the use of Mula and Uddiyana Bandha is prescribed.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Even the great Shankara says that Mula Bandha should always be practiced, since it is fit for raja yogins. In other words, even raja yogins &mdash; those who practice mind suspension and who are sometimes disparaging about Hatha yogins and their preoccupation with their bodies &mdash; should take up the practice of Mula Bandha, since it leads to going beyond mind. If we remember now Patanjali&rsquo;s definition of yoga being the suspension of mind, we begin to understand the importance of Mula and Uddiyana Bandha.</span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.orvu7o8o2jeb"><span class="c25 c3">Drishti</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">We move on now to drishti or focal point. As we have seen, the fifth limb of yoga is sense withdrawal (pratyahara). The Upanishads explain that the senses deliver the fuel for the mind in the form of sense objects. The mind then develops desires, which are the source of suffering. The mind&rsquo;s basic concept is that we are lacking. This lack, according to the mind, can only be alleviated through a constant supply of stimulation from outside.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The concept of yoga, on the other hand, holds that we are always in the original and pristine state of bliss, which is consciousness. This original state is formless, however; and, since the mind has the tendency to attach itself to whatever comes along next, we forget our true nature. Sense withdrawal means to accept the fact that external stimuli can never truly fulfill us. Once that is accepted, we are free to realize that what we were desperately looking for on the outside was present inside all along. The Upanishads explain further that, as a fire dies down when the fuel is withheld, so the mind will return to its source when the fuel of the senses is withheld. The method &mdash; or rather the collection of methods &mdash; by which this can be brought about is sense withdrawal (pratyahara).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>As has been explained, the withdrawal of the audio sense is brought about by listening to one&rsquo;s own breath rather than to external sounds. The withdrawal or turning in of the visual sense is practiced through </span><span class="c10">drishti, the attachment of one&rsquo;s gaze to various focal points.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;These are:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the nose</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the center of the forehead (third eye)</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the navel</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the hand</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the toes</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the side</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; toward the thumb</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; upward</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">By doing this, one prevents oneself from looking around, which would let the mind reach out. Following drishti, the practice becomes deeply internal and meditative.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>Drishti is also a practice of concentration (dharana), the sixth of Patanjali&rsquo;s limbs of yoga. If we practice in a distracted way, we may find ourselves listening to the birds outside and gazing around the room. To perform all of the prescribed actions &mdash; bandha, ujjayi, drishti, and finding proper alignment &mdash; </span><span class="c10">the mind needs to be fully concentrated</span><span class="c0 c3">; otherwise one of the elements will miss out. In this way the practice provides us with constant feedback about whether we are in dharana. In time dharana will lead to meditation (dhyana).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>Drishti has also a significant energetic aspect. According to the Yoga Yajnavalkya, which contains the yoga teachings of the sage Yajnavalkya, &ldquo;One must endeavour to retain all the prana through the mind, in the navel, the tip of the nose and the big toes. </span><span>Focussing at the </span><span class="c10">tip of the nose is the means to mastery over prana</span><span>. By focussing on the </span><span class="c10">navel all diseases are removed. The body attains lightness by focussing on the big toes.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;According to A. G. Mohan, a student of T. Krishnamacharya and translator of the Yoga Yajnavalkya, the aim of yoga is to concentrate the prana in the body, whereas it is usually scattered. A scattered prana will correspond to a scattered state of mind.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>The scattered state of mind is called vikshipta in the Yoga Sutra. Prana that is drawn inward and concentrated in the body corresponds to the single-pointed (ekagra) and suspended (nirodha) states of mind, which lead to objective (samprajnata) and objectless (asamprajnata) samadhi. In the Ashtanga Vinyasa method, drishti is one of the vital techniques to draw the prana inward. Anyone who has practiced in front of a mirror may have noticed how looking into it draws awareness away from the core toward the surface. Exactly this happens to the flow of prana, which follows awareness. Practicing in front of a mirror might be helpful from time to time to check one&rsquo;s alignment if no teacher is present, but it is preferable to develop </span><span class="c10">proprioceptive awareness &mdash; awareness that does not depend on visual clues.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;This type of awareness draws prana inward, which corresponds to what the Upanishads call dissolving the mind into the heart. The permanent establishing of prana in the core of the body leads to samadhi or liberation.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>As enthusiastic as some scriptures are about techniques like drishti, we have to remember we are still just operating within conditioned existence. The master Shankara reminds us: </span><span class="c3 c16 c10">&ldquo;Converting the ordinary vision into one of knowledge one should view the world as brahman (consciousness) itself. That is the noblest vision and not that which is directed to the tip of the nose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.4mssamht5bac"><span class="c25 c3">Vinyasa</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Vinyasa Yoga is a system of yoga specifically designed for householders. The difference between a householder (grihasta) and a renunciate (sannyasi) is that the latter has no social duties and can therefore devote ten or more hours per day to practice. In fact, if individual techniques pertaining to all the eight limbs were practiced daily, one would easily spend more than ten hours practicing. For example a wonderful day could be had by practicing asana for two hours, pranayama for two hours, mudra and japa (repetition of mantra) each for one hour, reading of scripture one hour, chanting of scripture one hour, reflection and contemplation one hour, meditation one hour.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">A householder &mdash; meaning someone who has a family and a job or a business to attend to &mdash; can never spend so much time on the practice. The idea of completely turning your back on society is actually fairly recent, relatively speaking. It was introduced by Gautama Buddha and elaborated on by Shankara. The ancient vedic and upanishadic rishis, although they spent considerable time in the forest, were not dropouts. Rishis like Yajnavalkya, Vasishta, and Vishvamitra had wives and children, and held positions such as priest or royal counselor.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">For a yoga practice to work for householders, it would be necessary to compress it into two hours and yet retain its benefits, and so the eight limbs would have to be practiced simultaneously and not sequentially. With this in mind Rishi Vamana created the Vinyasa Yoga. The rishi arranged the practice in sequences, such that the postures were potentiating their effects, and combined them with mudra, pranayama, and meditation so that a ten-hour practice could be effectively compressed into two hours.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">One of Vinyasa Yoga&rsquo;s outstanding features is that postures are not held for a long time. One of the greatest traps in physical yoga is to get identified with postures and preoccupied with the body. One thinks, &ldquo;Now I am sitting in Padmasana. This is yoga!&rdquo; One couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. To perceive the awareness that witnesses sitting in Padmasana &mdash; that is yoga.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The core idea of Vinyasa Yoga is to shift emphasis from posture to breath and therefore to realize that postures, like all forms, are impermanent. The formed &mdash; asanas, bodies of life-forms, structures, nations, planets, and so on &mdash; come and go. The quest of yoga is for the formless (consciousness) &mdash; for what was here before form arose and what will be here after form has subsided. For this reason it was necessary to organize the practice in such a way that nothing impermanent is held on to. Vinyasa Yoga is a meditation on impermanence.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The only thing permanent in the practice is the constant focus on the breath. According to the Brahma Sutra, &nbsp;&ldquo;ata eva pranah&rdquo; &mdash; the breath verily is Brahman. The breath is here identified as a metaphor for Brahman (that is, deep reality, ultimate reality, infinite consciousness). This assertion is based on the authority of the Chandogya Upanishad, where the question is asked: Which is that divinity? Answer: &ldquo;Breath . . . Verily, indeed all beings enter (into life) with breath and depart (from life) with breath.&rdquo; Through vinyasa the postures are linked to form a mala. A mala is commonly used to count mantras during mantra meditation, whereas in Vinyasa Yoga every asana becomes a bead on this mala of yoga postures. In this way the practice becomes a movement meditation.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c10">The practice produces heat, which is needed to burn toxins</span><span>. Not only physical toxins are meant here, but also the poison of ignorance and delusion. </span><span class="c10">The full-vinyasa practice, which entails coming back to standing between postures, has a flushing effect through the constant forward bending. </span><span>It can be recommended in cases of strong, persistent toxicity and for recuperation after disease. The </span><span class="c10">half-vinyasa practice</span><span>, in which one jumps back between performance of the right and left sides of sitting postures, is designed to </span><span class="c10">create a balance between strength and flexibility and to increase heat</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If asana only is practiced, this might lead to excess flexibility, which can destabilize the body. The proper position of the bones in the body, and especially of the spine, is remembered by sustaining a certain core tension in the muscles. If the tension is insufficient, frequent visits to a chiropractor or osteopath may become necessary.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span>In the vinyasa method, this possibility is avoided by jumping back between sides, which gives us the strength to support the amount of flexibility that is gained. This concept is important to understand. </span><span class="c10">Flexibility that cannot be supported by strength should not be aimed for</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The underlying principle here is that of simultaneous expansion into opposing directions. Whenever we expand into one direction, we at the same time need to counteract that by expanding into the opposite direction. In this way we are not caught into extremes of body and mind. Patanjali says, &ldquo;Thus one is unassailed by the pair of opposites.&rdquo;For this reason one needs to place the same importance on vinyasa as on asana. As Rishi Vamana put it, &ldquo;Oh Yogi, don&rsquo;t practice asana without vinyasa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.4tvi6tgicmhb"><span class="c25 c3">Vinyasa Count</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In colloquial language today, the term vinyasa is taken to refer to the jumping back and jumping through between the sides of postures (half vinyasa) and the movement that brings us to standing between postures (full vinyasa).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In the ancient treatise Yoga Korunta, vinyasa refers to every counted movement, accompanied by breath and focal point. The vinyasa count is a format in which the Rishi Vamana recorded the Ashtanga practice in the Yoga Korunta.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Each movement that is needed to enter and exit a posture in the traditional way is counted. Since the postures differ greatly not only from each other but also in the way in which they are entered and exited, they also differ very much in regard to the number of sequential movements that are needed to perform them (their vinyasa counts). So Padangushtasana has only three vinyasas (counted movements) whereas Supta Padangushtasana has twenty-eight. All vinyasas are flowing movements. The only one that is held is the vinyasa where we are in the state of the asana. To be in the state of the asana means to be in and to hold a posture. For Padangushtasana, for example, this is vinyasa three. This vinyasa is held usually for five breaths, though for therapeutic purposes it may be held for twenty-five breaths or more. The fact that one vinyasa may consist of up to twenty-five breaths leads us to the understanding that vinyasa count and the number of breaths, the breath count, are not identical.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In the following section I describe the postures following the half-vinyasa count. That is the way I learned it in Mysore and it is the normal mode of practice today.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To make this text more accessible to beginners I have counted the vinyasas in English. The original vinyasa count is, however, in Sanskrit, and it is important to preserve this precious tradition. Accordingly, I use the Sanskrit count when I conduct a vinyasa-count class. For those who want to study the vinyasa count more closely, I recommend K. Pattabhi Jois&rsquo;s Yoga Mala and Lino Mieles&rsquo;sAshtanga Yoga.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h1 class="c18 c12" id="h.mwlyind1d8g3"><span class="c17 c7">Philosophy</span></h1><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.r2yo3fm9bv1w"><span class="c14 c10 c7">Asana Names</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Like the entire creation, the names of the </span><span class="c16 c10 c7">asana</span><span class="c16 c10">s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be </span><span class="c16 c10">divided</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;into four groups: </span><span class="c16 c10">lifeless forms, animal forms, human forms, </span><span class="c0">and</span><span class="c16 c10">&nbsp;divine forms</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Asana</span><span class="c0">s such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Trikonasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Triangle Posture) and </span><span class="c0 c7">Navasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(Boat Posture), representing lifeless forms, occur predominantly in the Primary Series.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The Intermediate or Second Series is dominated by postures named after animals, for example </span><span class="c0 c7">Shalabasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Locust Posture), </span><span class="c0 c7">Kapotasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Pigeon Posture), and </span><span class="c0 c7">Krounchasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(Heron Posture).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The human race is represented by </span><span class="c0 c7">asana</span><span class="c0">s dedicated to the ancient </span><span class="c0 c7">rishi</span><span class="c0">s.

Absence of the </span><span class="c0 c7">Ujjayi</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;sound, shallow breathing, and fidgeting usually indicate that the mind has taken over and focus has been lost.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">In the </span><span class="c0 c7">Yoga Sutra</span><span class="c0">, Patanjali gives three stanzas on </span><span class="c0 c7">asana</span><span class="c0 c3">. Their simplicity is profound.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c16 c10">Posture is steadiness and ease.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c16 c10">True posture is then when effort ceases and meditation on infinity occurs.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c16 c10">In </span><span class="c16 c10 c7">asana</span><span class="c16 c10">&nbsp;there is no assault from the pairs of opposites.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.gfw3bn2shvz7"><span>Posture is steadiness and ease.</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This stanza describes the qualities of posture. Steadiness implies effort and strength. Ease implies relaxation and release. These opposites are complementary. The effort required to build a strong body produces steadiness and gives ease of posture.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.qzrlggbfuwy5"><span class="c14 c10 c7">True posture is then when effort ceases and meditation on infinity occurs.</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The ultimate aim of any limb of yoga is for us to experience our true nature. In practice, and in the following descriptions of how to perform each posture, sensitivity, awareness, and heightened concentration are demanded. Eventually, when the posture is known, we can drop the details and &ldquo;be&rdquo; in the posture. Effort ceases; the posture is expressed from within; meditation on infinity occurs. Infinity is a quality of our true nature.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.5oqwxx7pk8nr"><span class="c7">In</span><span>&nbsp;asana </span><span class="c14 c10 c7">there is no assault from the pairs of opposites.</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Steadiness and ease are themselves a pair of opposites, and yet, when in balance, each supports and allows the other to express itself fully. With excess effort the body becomes insensitive and the mind agitated. With excess ease the body becomes sluggish and the mind dull. Both aspects of this duality must be embraced. In his book </span><span class="c0 c7">Awareness through Movement</span><span class="c0 c3">, Moshe Feldenkrais points out that, if one lifts an iron bar and a fly alights on it, no difference can be noticed. If, however, you hold a feather you will notice if a fly lands on or takes off from it. With excess effort there is no room for improvement, as full effort has already been exerted. Sensitivity reserves the space to observe differences, to adapt the posture and to learn. In the space between the opposites, the mind falls still.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.auvs5hg3vbds"><span class="c14 c10 c7">Action and Counteraction / Posture and Counterposture</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">These opposites also exist as fundamental differences between the actions that transport us into a posture and those that maintain it. As a rule of thumb, actions that take us into a posture need to be reversed when working in the posture itself. For example, while forward bending is performed by the hip flexors, once we are in the posture we use the hamstrings, which are hip extensors.2 Backbending is performed by the trunk extensors, but once in the posture we counteract these by engaging the abdominal muscles. To arrive in </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Konasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;we use the external hip rotators; once in the posture we use the internal hip rotators.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The fact that every action performed in yoga does not continue endlessly means that we automatically perform the opposing action to counteract it and so reach a balanced state. As each posture is balanced by a counterposture, so each action within the posture is balanced by its counteraction until a neutral position is reached.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The neutral position is that in which the initial action has been balanced and correct alignment has been achieved. Alignment is correct when steadiness and lightness in the posture are achieved, holding it becomes effortless, and meditation is possible. This state is reached when all actions are balanced by opposing actions.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The posture remains alive and active as we continually play with balancing these opposites.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.uzm2w6rxvb1c"><span class="c14 c10 c7">How to Stretch</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">There are three ways to stretch in a posture: passive, active, and dynamic/ballistic stretching. An example of passive stretching would be folding your torso forward from a standing position and then just hanging from your hip joints with your arms dangling down or your elbows clasped. Passive stretching is relatively ineffective, as it takes a long time to produce results. A person with high muscle tension could hang in a passive stretch for half an hour without getting very far.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This type of stretching has the added disadvantage of not protecting the muscle stretched. For example, if in the posture previously described we reached for the toes and drew the torso down with our arms, the stretch would mainly be taken at the origin of the hamstring muscles, the ischial tuberosities, which are a part of the sit bones. This can result in tearing of muscle fibers, the so-called pulling of the hamstrings. Another downside of passive stretching is that it does not build strength to support the flexibility gained.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The technique employed in Ashtanga Yoga is active stretching. In this type of stretching we use an inherent reflex without which the body could not move. Whenever a muscle contracts, its antagonist (the muscle with the opposite function) releases. To understand this reflex one may look at the elbow joint. When the biceps (biceps brachii) contracts, the triceps (triceps brachii) releases, so that the elbow may be flexed. If the triceps also contracted, the elbow could not move. Likewise, when the triceps contracts, the nervous system simultaneously sends a signal to the biceps to release, and the elbow is extended.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">A muscle that is being stretched will receive a signal to release when the opposing muscle is activated. In addition to gravity, it will also be stretched by the strength of the opposing muscle. At the same time, the opposing muscle will be exercised and increase in strength. With this method we will be able to close a joint &mdash; flex it &mdash; to about 85 percent. To access the remaining 15 percent, we will use a technique we call &ldquo;active release,&rdquo; which is covered later.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The other form of stretching is dynamic stretching, mainly used in martial arts, rhythmic gymnastics, and calisthenics. Here one uses momentum to stretch. It is not often employed in yoga as it is considered too forceful. There are some exceptions in Vinyasa Yoga, such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Supta Konasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the Primary Series and </span><span class="c0 c7">Supta Vajrasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the Intermediate Series. Dropping into a backbend from standing, handstand drop-backs, and </span><span class="c0 c7">Viparita Chakrasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;are other examples of dynamic stretching.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Apart from these exceptions, active stretching is used in the whole of the Ashtanga Yoga practice.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.gt5d0i50tux2"><span>Full </span><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span>&nbsp;versus Half </span><span class="c14 c10 c7">Vinyasa</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">With the full-</span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;system, one returns to </span><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(the basic standing posture) between each and every </span><span class="c0 c7">asana</span><span class="c0">. The format I learned from Shri K. Pattabhi Jois in Mysore was the half-</span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;system. This has one return to </span><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;between different standing postures but transiting from one sitting posture to the next without coming to standing. This approach appears to be the more common one today.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">It can be advisable to practice full </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for some time to improve strength and stamina, for example after recovery from disease or to speed up metabolism. The full-</span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;approach has an intensified flushing effect and can stimulate a sluggish liver. Although full </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is more work, it also allows time for the practitioner &ldquo;to come up for air&rdquo; so to speak, and may actually de-intensify a practice. It certainly does eventually repay the energy expended. However, as a long-term practice it may be difficult to sustain.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.z707n5v0bwbr"><span class="c14 c10 c7">Temperature</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">If you practice in a hot country, you will heat up quickly. This is especially true of males. Care needs to be taken not to overheat if one is engaging in strenuous practice in a hot environment. As with any type of engine, so also with the human body: overheating is not good. </span><span class="c28 c10">Sweating is healthy, but if sweat drips from the body it is a sign that the body is no longer able to cool itself adequately.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sweating to this degree on a daily basis literally drains life force from the body. </span><span class="c28 c10">A temperature of 68&deg;F</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would be ideal for practice, with a range of 15&deg; below and above that still possible, </span><span class="c28 c10">but practice speed needs to be adapted &mdash; faster when it&rsquo;s cold to increase heat and slower when it&rsquo;s hot to cool down.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;On a hot day, focus on the cooling quality of the breath.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Heating the yoga room to above 77&deg; may produce more flexibility, but it decreases strength, stamina, and concentration. If yoga were only about flexibility, contortionists would be the greatest yogis. It is worth noting that extreme flexibility is often a result of biochemical imbalance. </span><span class="c3 c16 c10">True posture is about the ability to focus deeply within.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The Ashtanga Vinyasa practice attempts to balance flexibility with strength. Real yoga &ldquo;will walk the edge between opposing extremes.&rdquo;3 Rather than desperately cranking ourselves into one particular direction in a posture, we expand simultaneously in all directions. The first pair of opposites that we discover in physical yoga is strength/flexibility. Excess flexibility is an obstacle because it means loss of strength and vice versa. We should never build up a degree of flexibility that is not matched by the necessary support strength. On the other hand, building up great strength without increasing one&rsquo;s flexibility restricts the range of joint movement.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">A heated yoga room helps flexibility because it increases </span><span class="c0 c7">vata</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">pitta</span><span class="c0">. A cold yoga room helps strength because it increases </span><span class="c0 c7">kapha</span><span class="c0">. A cold room also increases awareness and attention to detail. We have to study the posture more deeply to get to the same point in a cold room, but this pays off in terms of benefits. </span><span class="c28 c10">There is more learning if the temperature is low, and the body becomes sturdier due to the awakening of physical intelligence</span><span class="c0 c3">. We can avoid this process by turning up the thermostat, but everybody who has worked through a couple of winters with only moderate heating values the gain in refinement that it brings.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">If temperatures are high, proper ventilation is necessary. The western fashion of keeping all windows closed in sweltering temperatures so that you can see puddles of sweat on the floor is surprising, considering that I have never seen a yoga room in India that even had closeable windows. The </span><span class="c0 c7">Hatha Yoga Pradipika</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;warns in several places of the dangers of too much heat and too much heating, by staying too close to the fire for example, and also of excess physical exertion. Getting too cold, for instance by taking cold morning baths, is also not recommended. The idea here is moderation: staying away from the extremes and abiding in the center. Once a yogi is fully established, however, extremes will no longer be of concern.</span><hr><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h1 class="c18 c12" id="h.6gtawfo6r1xr"><span class="c7 c17">Samasthiti</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">EQUAL STANDING</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c10 c7">Drishti</span><span class="c3 c16 c10">&nbsp;: Nose</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 204.00px; height: 500.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image98.jpg" style="width: 204.00px; height: 500.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c7">Samasthiti</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the basic standing posture.

The straight line of the foot is from the second toe to the center of the heel. If we were to bring the heels together, the thighbones (femurs) would be outwardly rotated to a slight extent.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">We start by establishing </span><span class="c28 c10 c7">Ujjayi</span><span class="c28 c10">&nbsp;breathing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with a smooth and even sound. </span><span class="c28 c10">The rib cage expands evenly </span><span class="c0">in all four directions, and the </span><span class="c28 c10 c7">bandha</span><span class="c28 c10">s are consciously engaged </span><span class="c0">if they have not automatically been initiated with the breath. The inhalation reaches down in front of the spine and hooks into the pelvic floor, creating a lifting sensation from the center of the perineum (</span><span class="c0 c7">Mula Bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">). At the same time, the lower abdominal wall, between the navel and the pubic bone, gently draws in toward the spine. The natural up-and-down movement of the diaphragm and the accompanying movement of the upper abdomen or stomach area are unrestricted.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The toes spread as one would spread one&rsquo;s fingers, in order to completely awaken the feet. The weight of the body is placed above the ankles and equally distributes to all four corners of the feet &mdash; the bases of the large and little toes and the inside and outside edges of the heels. The body weight is also evenly distributed between the inner and outer arches of the foot, while the arches are lifted and active. The action of the toes influences the pubic bone while the heels relate to the tailbone (coccyx).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The fronts of the thighs are contracted, with the quadriceps pulling up the kneecaps. Quadriceps means four heads, referring to the four points of origin of this large muscle group. All four heads join into the common quadriceps tendon, which leads down to the shin. The kneecap (patella), a floating bone, is embedded within it.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Many students will have to tilt the pelvis posteriorly (backward), which reduces any excess curvature in the low back and makes one stand taller. This movement is achieved by engaging the abdominal muscles, which lifts the pubic bone as the coccyx drops. The strength of the legs creates a vector of energy whose resonance is felt up the entire length of the body&rsquo;s core.</span></p><p class="c4 c31"><span class="c16 c20 c10 c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The front of the rib cage, the sternum, is lifted. (In common with many teachers, I will refer to this area as the heart.) One way of doing this pinches the shoulder blades (scapulae) together, which puffs the chest out as in a military posture of attention. This leads to a hardening and closing of the area behind the heart. Instead, as the heart is lifted, the area of the back behind the kidneys broadens and the shoulder blades widen and gently sink down the back. The shoulder blades flatten onto the back of the chest and support the elevated and open position of the heart area. The lower ribs in the front of the chest soften back in toward the body. The arms may need to be &ldquo;looped&rdquo;5 in the shoulder joint to reposition the head of the arm bone (humerus) so that it sits in the center of the shoulder joint. These actions leave the chest open and broad in all directions. The rib cage and lungs are free to expand, facilitating a full, free-flowing breath.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.kmhjrq5a5uer"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.uyavg2zczd9t"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Inner Integrity</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The bony vertebrae of the spine house the spinal cord, and its nerve ends exit between each vertebral body. The strong outer form of every posture supports the spine, enabling it to be fluid and extend freely. The nervous system remains unimpaired. This is the inner integrity that should be maintained within every posture.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Many chronic diseases, aches, and cultural ailments do not come from sick organs but from poor posture, which results in compression of the spine and impairment of the spinal nerves. Restoring the spine to its original state can alleviate these symptoms.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The spine becomes weak through lack of exercise and eventually loses its alignment due to weakness of the core muscles of the body. In many cases the spine actually shortens. The </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa </span><span class="c0 c3">method is an ideal tool to invigorate the spine and restore its natural elasticity. Any hardening, or any inability to extend the spine in a posture, is a sign of overexertion.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The chin drops slightly while the ears move back in line with the shoulders. Drawing the ears back in line with the shoulders corrects the common postural condition of a forward head, where the ears are positioned in front of the shoulders when viewed from the side. In some cases this may measure more than four inches, which usually indicates that one&rsquo;s mind is racing ahead of one&rsquo;s actions. At the other extreme, those who remain in the past with their thoughts will often lean well back when they stand.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 350.67px; height: 542.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image43.jpg" style="width: 350.67px; height: 542.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.uwyo18ur93n1"><span class="c19 c0">FIGURE 1 : SPINE WITH PELVIS AND CRANIUM</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The human spine has four natural curves. The first primary curve, developed in the fetal stage of life, is kyphotic and is retained throughout life in the thoracic spine and the sacrum. The first secondary curve (lordotic) is developed in the neck (cervical spine) as a baby lifts and supports the weight of its head. The second lordotic curve, in the lumbar spine, develops during infancy upon standing and walking. These natural curvatures complement each other and reduce the compressive forces placed upon an upright spine. Work to balance any imbalance or excesses within this natural form. Care should be taken to avoid a &ldquo;military stance,&rdquo; which is a lack or excess of any one of these natural curves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 54.67px; height: 300.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 54.67px; height: 300.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 400.00px; height: 518.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image125.jpg" style="width: 400.00px; height: 518.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4 c31"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.sicgaw35el6r"><span class="c19 c0">FIGURE 2 : ERECTOR SPINAE</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The erector spinae keeps the spine and thus the torso upright. Since it is situated posterior to the spine, it extends the spine (bends it backward) as it contracts. Its origin on the posterior crest of the ilium (hip bone) and the sacrum enables it to excessively curve the low back if it is permanently shortened.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The insertion of the erector spinae at the base of the skull enables it to take the head back. The many layers of the erector spinae also originate and insert at the transverse and spinous processes of most vertebrae and at the ribs, through which this complex muscle can maintain the integrity of the spine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 64.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image133.jpg" style="width: 64.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.s8b0z6almvpf"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.ewitkfza2gcm"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Postural Balance</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Equal distribution of the weight of the body in the feet is imperative for balanced posture. When the body weight is placed too far forward in the feet, the low back (lumbar spine) hollows excessively (hyperlordosis) as the sacrum and coccyx lift. This puts excessive compressive forces onto the lumbar intervertebral discs and tightens the corresponding musculature (erector spinae and quadratus lumborum).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">At the same time this positioning of the pelvis causes the abdominal muscles to release and weaken and the ribs to flare open. The area of the back behind the kidneys tightens and constricts, while the neck straightens, losing its natural lordotic curve, in an attempt to compensate for the excessive curvature produced in the lumbar spine and to bring the head back in line with the body&rsquo;s center of gravity.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">On the other hand, if the weight is too far back in the feet, the hamstrings tighten and draw the pelvis and coccyx down in the back, while the pubic bone lifts at the front of the pelvis. As the body always strives toward equilibrium, this posture is usually accompanied by an increased curvature in the chest or thoracic spine (hyperkyphosis). The heart area collapses and the abdominals tighten. The shoulders round and the head shifts forward as the body compensates in an attempt to keep the center of gravity over the feet.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If too much weight is placed on the inside of the feet, the inner arches will collapse, placing stress on the medial menisci of the knees. This usually results in an anterior tilt of the pelvis, leading to excessive lumbar curvature.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">To complete the picture, lift the highest point of the back of the head up toward the ceiling without losing the grounding of the feet. This action elongates and awakens the entire spine. Indian yogis have the exemplary tendency to humbly cast their gaze downward in </span><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0 c3">. T.

The neck should always move as an extension of the spine, as indeed it is. The gaze lifts at the same pace as the lift of the arms. When the palms meet we are gazing up to the thumbs.

Beginners and those with tight and shortened hamstring muscles should take care to keep the low back straight. As necessary, bend the knees when the pelvis no longer folds forward and the low back begins to round instead. Rounding of the low back places strain on the discs of the lumbar spine, eliminating the intended action of stretching the ham-string muscles.

This is the creative aspect of the posture. As we exhale, we release and relax into the new space gained. If you cannot breathe freely and extend the spine with your exhalation, you are trying too hard. All postures need to be worked with awareness, sensitivity and intelligence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 334.67px; height: 420.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image77.jpg" style="width: 334.67px; height: 420.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c10 c7">Surya Namaskara</span><span class="c16 c10">&nbsp;A, </span><span class="c16 c10 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c3 c16 c10">&nbsp;three</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The abdominal muscles should be firm and supportive but not overcontracted, as this action would shorten the spine.

Completing the exhalation, slowly bend the arms, lowering your body until you hover just above the floor. The elbows hug the body. Do not allow them to wander out to the sides: this stiffens the shoulders and tightens the pectoralis minor muscle. On the way down, the movement should be even, with the heart leading the way. Lift your face away from the floor to strengthen and support the back of the neck. By extending out through the heels, the coccyx drops, which lengthens the low back and positions the pelvis correctly for Upward Facing Dog, which follows. This action is balanced by an equal extension of the chest forward.

Rolling the shoulders back will free up the chest to move forward and puff out proudly like that of a lion. Imagine the arms as the upright support of a swing, the shoulder joints as the fulcrum, and the chest as the seat of the swing. Slide the heart through the arms to gain length in the spine. The lowest ribs now move forward and lift upward.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Lifting the chin to the ceiling and keeping the back of the neck long, the head is taken back. Those with previous whiplash injuries should avoid this movement and keep the neck straight, gazing down toward the tip of the nose; this will prevent overcontraction of the back of the neck. Students who are in need of inducing more backbend can look up between the eyebrows. At the same time be careful not to limit the backbend to the neck only.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">This posture is frequently confused with </span><span class="c0 c7">Bhujangasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(Cobra) from Hatha Yoga, and often hybrids between the two postures can be observed. Upward Facing Dog is distinctly different. As well as the arms being straight, the legs are kept strong and straight, so much so that the knees remain off the floor. The strength in the legs provides support for the lumbar spine. By keeping the legs straight, the stretch is taken in the front of the hip joint, lengthening the hip flexor muscles, which is imperative in all backbending postures. It is important to draw forward with the arms and lengthen the whole spine, rather than to collapse and dip into the low back. Incorrectly performed, this posture can easily lead to low-back pain. Performed correctly, it can relieve back pain caused by spending long hours sitting at a desk or in a driver&rsquo;s seat.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.o90z3sz7thoy"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.drsud1a2mdax"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Spinal Junctions</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The place where the spine meets the head (the cranium) is one of the important junctions of the spine. The others are the last cervical vertebra (C7) and the first thoracic vertebra (T1); the last thoracic vertebra (T12) and first lumbar vertebra (L1); and where the last lumbar vertebra (L5) articulates with the sacrum (S1-5). Laterally, the sacrum articulates with the pelvis, the sacroiliac (SI) joints. These are all areas where the spine encounters greater stresses. These areas have muscle attachments that work in opposing directions to equip us with a greater range of movement possibilities. It is therefore important to work these areas with awareness and respect in regard to their structural limitations and their vulnerability.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">At the same time, the rectus abdominis muscle (the six-pack muscle) must be engaged to anchor the lower ribs and prevent them flaring open. Flaring the lower ribs accentuates swaying of the low back. The rectus abdominis will also lift the pubic bone and allow the coccyx to drop. This will enable one to carry the spine long and tall in all postures.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is an extremely important posture in the sequence, as it is the only real preparation for backbending in the Primary Series. It should be deeply experienced every time it occurs in the series to awaken the spine for backbending. Take your time, with long, conscious inhalations rather than a short breath, moving quickly into and out of this posture.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.ewfv8uyk8shq"><span>Vinyasa</span><span>&nbsp;Six (</span><span>Adho Mukha Shvanasana</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; Downward Facing Dog)</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">With the beginning of the exhalation, flex your feet and roll back onto the soles. Release the heels toward the floor. Raise your buttocks to the sky like a mountain as the hip flexors engage and the legs work toward straightening. At the same time, push the floor away with your hands to shift weight back toward the feet. Set your shoulders broad with the armpits facing downward. If the shoulders are hunched around the ears, the armpits will face out to the sides; performed this way the trapezius muscle is overcontracted and the posture will tighten the neck and the shoulders. The correct shoulder position needs to be learned here, as it builds upper-body strength and is needed later on in backbends and arm balances. If the armpits face out to the sides, the arm bones (humeri) need to be outwardly rotated until the desirable result is achieved.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.hjdi8rjlpehi"><span class="c0 c19">PRACTICAL TIP</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.xacehcwmzvov"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Stance Variations in the Dogs</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The Upward and Downward Dog postures also have their intrinsic stances, which differ from person to person and may even change within one&rsquo;s practice life.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">A person with a stiff backbend needs a longer stance in Upward Dog. If the stance is too short, the low back or neck muscles can spasm. A beginner will get more opening and be safer by choosing a longer stance. As the spine becomes more flexible in backbend, one can shorten the stance in Upward Dog.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Initiated by the feet, the legs work strongly in Downward Facing Dog. Attempt to ground the heels with weight equal to that which naturally falls into the balls of the feet. The strong action of the legs and hip flexors is used to tip the pelvis forward, tilting the sit bones so that they point up toward the ceiling. Those with a flexible forward bend must resist the tendency to sag in the low back by keeping the junction of T12/L1 supported. The junction of T1/C7 is also supported, preventing the inside of the shoulders and the head from collapsing toward the floor. Instead, the top of the back of the head reaches forward toward the hands. Keep the chin dropped to the extent that there is no hardening in the front of the throat. The arms work as if you would try to lift your hands off the floor. The weight in the hands is cast forward so that only 40 percent is placed on the heels of the hands while the roots of the fingers carry 60 percent. Be sure that the bases of the little and ring fingers carry a load equal to that taken by the thumbs and pointing fingers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 348.00px; height: 273.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image148.jpg" style="width: 348.00px; height: 273.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Surya Namaskara</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A, </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;six (Downward Facing Dog)</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The arms and legs act as strong supports so that the spine may be fully lengthened. The trunk flexors and trunk extensors are stretched, strengthened, and awakened, and carry the spine elongated.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Anyone who experiences stiffness in forward bending or who has short Achilles tendons needs a short stance in Downward Dog. If the heels are more than an inch or two off the floor, the angle of the legs to the floor does not enable the legs to be worked in such a way as to get sufficient stretch on the calves and Achilles tendons. In this case one needs to step the feet forward and shorten the stance. On the other hand, if the stance is too short the strengthening and lengthening effect on the spine and shoulders is reduced. To maximize this effect, ideally we would choose a long stance. For beginners, however, a long stance will place undue strain on the shoulders and wrists. Once the heels reach the floor, one should therefore lengthen the stance in Downward Dog. A competent teacher can assess the appropriate stance length.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 332.00px; height: 390.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image53.jpg" style="width: 332.00px; height: 390.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.t9b6c35rzl8p"><span class="c7">FIGURE 4:</span><span class="c0 c20 c7">&nbsp;INFRASPINATUS</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The infraspinatus muscle outwardly rotates the humerus. &ldquo;Infra&rdquo; means below, &ldquo;spinatus&rdquo; means spine, referring to the ridge of the shoulder blade (scapula).

The sit bones are heavy and sink toward the floor.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 280.00px; height: 325.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image52.jpg" style="width: 280.00px; height: 325.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 89.33px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image24.jpg" style="width: 89.33px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Above, </span><span class="c0 c7">Surya Namaskara</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A, </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;eight; right, </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;nine</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Approach the limit of your flexibility slowly when squatting down, to give the ligaments time to lengthen and strengthen.

The front knee is bent and remains tracking directly above the ankle. To track the knee farther out beyond the ankle would promote forward travel of the femur (thighbone) on the tibia. Although this movement is prevented by the posterior cruciate ligament, it places undue strain on it and should be avoided.

This is achieved through totally awakening the back foot by spreading the base of the toes and keeping the outer arch of the foot grounded. Extending out through the heel of this foot will automatically position the foot at the perfect angle complementary to the direction of the knee of that leg. This also enhances the inward (medial) spiraling required by the back leg in this posture. The bent leg spirals outward (laterally) to complement its partner, until a neutral position is reached &mdash; that is, when the hips are square. Although there is an obvious preponderance of weight distribution into the forward leg, maintain the action of distributing weight back into the back foot by grounding the heel of that foot. This will create equilibrium between the flow of action in the legs. The strong support of the legs creates a vector of energy that supports the base of the spine and activates the </span><span class="c0 c7">bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">s, enabling the core of the body to rise.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.97dxu967rvyb"><span class="c19 c0">YOGIC CONTEXT</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.jxuqead4v4jc"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Importance of Correct Foot Position</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0">All foot positions given in the standing postures mirror the direction of the knee at its final position in the posture.

In other words, the knee joint would do the rotation needed to accommodate the position of the foot. A 45&deg; angle is therefore necessary on the back foot to work the hip into the required position. To place the foot so that it faces in the same direction as the knee protects the knee joint from excessive rotational force.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">While arriving in the final posture, the arms are simultaneously being raised above the head.

Pressure on the discs between the vertebrae deforms them into a wedge shape and predisposes them to bulging. The intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers for the vertebrae. They consist of a fibrous band enclosing a fluid-filled nucleus. When this liquid-filled cushion is pushed beyond the boundary of the vertebrae, it is called a disc bulge. Often the disc will press against the spinal cord and cause considerable pain. The adjacent muscles spasm to arrest and thereby protect the spine, resulting in a complete inability to bend forward. A disc bulge usually corrects itself in a few weeks. A disc prolapse differs from this in that the fibrous nucleus of the disc is pushed beyond the boundary of the vertebrae. Allopathy6 considers that this condition does not repair itself.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It is therefore important to avoid rounding the low back when bending forward, as in this position it bears the weight of the body. Instead, bend the knees while still maintaining some stretch in the hamstring muscles.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Inhaling, grow the legs tall and strong, and lift the torso up and out of the hips. Exhaling, fold forward at the hip joints, keeping the back straight and the heart lifted. Reach for the toes, hooking the big toes with the first and second fingers, palms facing inward, and closing the clasp of the fingers with the thumb. Students who cannot yet reach their toes may bend their legs. Bending of the low back toreach the toes is not recommended, as this places pressure on the lumbar discs, and may cause them to bulge.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 430.67px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image189.jpg" style="width: 430.67px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.qq4dfml57ty8"><span class="c7">FIGURE 6</span><span>&nbsp;DISC BULGE</span></h4><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 105.33px; height: 200.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image29.jpg" style="width: 105.33px; height: 200.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">On the next inhalation, keeping hold of the toes, lift the head and chest and cast the gaze up between the eyebrows.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.8k3z3t5k5i"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Two</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">On exhalation, fold deeply forward, lifting the kneecaps.

Too often one sees students who contract their entire body. Active balancing strengthens the core muscles of the body as well as the superficial muscles. This creates a light carriage, as the skeletal structure is carried more efficiently. </span><span class="c0 c7">Pada Hastasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is a great posture to experience these principles at work.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.qp2oopev8hi3"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Two</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Exhaling, fold forward. You are now in the state of </span><span class="c0 c7">Pada Hastasana</span><span class="c0 c3">. Hold it for five breaths. As in the previous posture, keep the low back straight and, only when that is guaranteed, work at straightening the legs. The gaze is toward the nose. This posture is a more intense version of the previous one. You can make the stretch even more intense by shifting weight forward toward the toes.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The abdominal muscles &mdash; the term refers primarily to rectus abdominis &mdash; are engaged here to protect the low back. </span><span class="c0 c7">Uddiyana Bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(the lower part of the transverse abdominis) prevents the breath from distending the lower belly, which would destabilize the low back. Excess use of the abdominal muscles, however, would shorten the spine and lift the head away from the floor, as the abdominal muscles are primarily trunk flexors. Only a sensitive combination of leg work with trunk flexion and trunk extension will bring the desired result of elongating the spine. This is mainly felt at the waist. Subtle, intelligent work will increase the space between the lowest ribs and the pelvic crests, the upper rims of the hipbone. Both muscle groups of the trunk work isometrically (under tension but without shortening) and therefore both will be strengthened. This is active balancing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 300.00px; height: 430.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image174.jpg" style="width: 300.00px; height: 430.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Pada Hastasana</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.srfiry79rji3"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Three</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Inhaling, lift the head and chest as you straighten the arms.

The flexing of the hip joints is limited by the hamstring muscle group, which performs the action of hip extension and knee flexion. The hamstring group consists of three individual muscles. Of these the biceps femoris externally rotates the femur as it extends the hip, and the semitendinosus and semimembranosus internally rotate the femur as they extend the hip. We will encounter these muscles later in their secondary function as rotators of the femur.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">If we passively hang in </span><span class="c0 c7">Padangushtasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, soreness can develop at the ischial tuberosities (sit bones), which is the origin of the hamstrings. To prevent this we need to engage the antagonists of the hamstrings, the quadriceps.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The quadriceps is engaged by pulling up on the kneecap (patella). The quadriceps consists of four separate muscles that jointly insert, via the patella tendon, at the tibia. The four heads of the quadriceps are the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis. The rectus femoris is the only two-joint muscle in the group. It originates at the front of the hip bone and can thus not only extend the leg at the knee but also flex the hip joint. The three vasti originate at the lateral, anterior, and medial surfaces of the femur respectively, and only perform extension of the knee joint.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 70.67px; height: 150.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image180.jpg" style="width: 70.67px; height: 150.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c12 c13" id="h.gynywpvdicmp"><span class="c17 c7"></span></h1><h1 class="c18 c12" id="h.mwmh41e8g6fa"><span class="c17 c7">Utthita Trikonasana</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">TRIANGLE POSTURE</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Drishti</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;Raised hand</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.g4uuv9yftul8"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;One</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Inhaling, turn to the right and hop your feet about three feet apart and parallel. The arms extend out to the sides at shoulder level.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">There is no &ldquo;one stance fits all&rdquo; here, but rather an ideal stance for every level of flexibility. This is of such importance that it should be assessed by the teacher on an individual basis. If the stance is too long, the inner integrity of the posture will be lost and its execution will bring little benefit. If it is too short, one will not gain spinal support, strength, and elongation. As flexibility increases over time and with practice, stances can be lengthened.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.k6b1ksj9j93z"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Two</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Exhaling, turn your right foot out 90&deg;. For the sake of precision, visualize a line going through the center of your mat lengthwise. Place the second toe of the right foot precisely along this line and check that the center of the heel is placed on the same line. A deviation of only 2&deg; could be significant. Beginners often turn the foot out too much in order to gain stability, but this will result in a lateral (outward) rotation of the tibia, which is sometimes accompanied by a compensating inward rotation of the femur. This places stress on the knee. Dancers often prematurely wear out their knees through turning the feet out in this way.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Turn your left foot in approximately 5&deg;, with the heel positioned on the same center-line on the mat. The 5&deg; position will ensure that foot, shin, and thighbone all point in the same direction, again as the optimal position for the knee. To stay at 0&deg;, or to turn the foot out, would place stress on the knee joint. On the other hand, if you turn the left foot in too far, say 30&deg;, you will not achieve sufficient opening of the groins.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">With the feet correctly positioned, let the right hip drop down (lateral tilt) as far as possible, bringing the pelvis toward being vertical to the floor. If the pelvis is left in a horizontal position, the spine has to flex laterally (sideways), which is not intended in this posture. The left hip swings up and out to the left to allow the right hip to drop.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Opposite, </span><span class="c0 c20 c7">Utthita Trikonasana</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 409.56px; height: 575.50px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image129.jpg" style="width: 409.56px; height: 575.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.b2kug4d17e2m"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.jyg52x94x9n1"><span class="c0 c20 c7">The Knee Joint</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The knee is a modified hinge joint. A hinge joint can move in only one plane, but the knee does allow for some rotation. The action of straightening the leg is performed primarily by the quadriceps femoris muscle (front of the thigh), while the primary knee flexors, the hamstrings, draw the heel to the buttocks. But if we sit on a chair with the thighs held firm, we notice that we can swivel the feet left or right and the tibias will follow the movement.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The knee joint is complex, as the femur and tibia do not articulate well with each other. The lower end of the femur consists of two rounded protuberances called condyles, similar to two wheels, that roll &mdash; and also glide &mdash; over the upper end of the tibia. To cushion and secure this movement, two half-moon-shaped cartilages, the medial and lateral menisci, lie between the bones. Their function is similar to that of rail tracks for a train, the train being the femur and the wheels being the condyles. The difference is that the menisci actually follow the movement of the femur to allow for the roll and glide.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If the leg rapidly extends under pressure, the menisci may be unable to withdraw fast enough and are crushed. If we attempt to rotate the knee joint and at the same time straighten the leg against resistance, we can inflict serious damage, as often happens in some sports. The knee joint should never be rotated when under pressure or bearing weight.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Torn menisci heal very slowly, and medical doctors usually recommend surgery, but in many cases meniscus injuries can be healed with yoga in six to eighteen months. Cartilage has minimal blood vessels and therefore minimal nutrient supply, which is needed for the healing process. Yoga accelerates healing because the postures and transitions, when performed with precision, stimulate nutrient exchange. To heal a damaged knee will take much perseverance and patience, and especially careful precision. Whoever has worked with a meniscus injury knows that a change of only 2&deg; in the positioning of the feet in standing postures can make the difference between comfort and healing and pain and aggravation.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Most knee problems, however, do not start with meniscus problems but with a strain of the cruciate ligaments. The posterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from dislocating forward on the tibia, while the anterior cruciate ligament prevents backward dislocation. They are named after their points of insertion on the tibia, in the back and front respectively. Once the cruciate ligaments are strained, the knee becomes loose or unstable. Imprecise tracking of the femur on the tibia results, leading to wear on the menisci.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Strain of the cruciate ligaments comes about through hyperextension of the leg, in other words its extension beyond 180&deg;. The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the popliteus muscle restrict hyperextension, but it will occur if sufficient stress is applied. Continuous hyperextension of the leg will eventually weaken and strain the cruciate ligaments.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Hyperextension of the knee can often be observed in </span><span class="c0 c7">Trikonasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, students with low muscle tension being especially predisposed to it. Lifting the knee away from the floor and isometrically engaging the hamstrings counteracts this tendency. The engaging of the hamstrings can be achieved by attempting to draw or swipe the front foot over the floor toward the back foot. The foot will of course not move because it carries weight, but the muscles used to perform the action &mdash; the hamstrings &mdash; will engage. This important action needs to be performed in all postures where the front leg is straight.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If pain in the back of the knee persists, the knee needs to be bent slightly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 409.33px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image47.jpg" style="width: 409.33px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.9yzszcvs3rsu"><span class="c7">FIGURE 8:</span><span class="c19 c0">&nbsp;KNEE JOINT</span></h4><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 144.00px; height: 250.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 144.00px; height: 250.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Reach out to the side and then down, imagining staying between two panes of glass that prevent any leaning of the torso out in front. The left shoulder remains on one plane above the right leg. The right hand eventually clasps the right big toe. If you are not able to reach the toe without compromising the posture (laterally flexing the spine), place your hand on the foot or shin. Do not lean into this leg, but keep both sides of the torso and neck lengthening and supported away from the floor. If it is comfortable, turn the head to gaze up to the thumb of the left hand, which hovers above the left shoulder. Keep the neck in a straight line with the rest of your spine without performing an unnecessary backbend in your neck. Otherwise gaze out to the side. Five breaths.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Getting into </span><span class="c0 c7">Utthita Trikonasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we externally rotated the right femur to turn the foot out. Once in the posture, we inwardly rotate the femur until we reach the neutral position. The left thigh, which was medially (inwardly) rotated to take us into the posture, is laterally rotated once in the posture until the leg is again in the neutral position, with the four corners of the foot equally grounded. Check especially that both the outside of the left foot and the base of the right big toe are grounded. There needs to be a subtle balance between grounding the inner and outer arches of the front foot. This will lead to a subtle balance of inward and outward rotation of the thigh of the front leg, which is necessary for the hamstrings to lengthen evenly. Many beginners have a tendency to roll the thigh out to escape the stretching of the inner hamstrings &mdash; a tendency also common in </span><span class="c0 c7">Padangushtasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, that needs to be counteracted if present.

Beginners will need to break down the surprisingly complex entry movement into its constituents.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">From the middle position, first shorten the stance by four to eight inches, unless you have really long hamstrings. Shortening the stance deducts the difference in distance between the hip joints from the intrinsic stance of </span><span class="c0 c7">Utthita Trikonasana</span><span class="c0">, where the hips are parallel to the mat, to that in </span><span class="c0 c7">Parivrta Trikonasana</span><span class="c0">, where they are square. Otherwise the position of the sacrum will be compromised &mdash; it should be parallel the floor &mdash; and the position of the spine will be compromised as a result. Students might think keeping the longer stance will produce a greater stretch, a more thrilling sensation, but in fact it impinges on the flow of </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;up the </span><span class="c0 c7">sushumna</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(the central energy channel of the subtle body) and of cerebrospinal fluid in the gross body, which may or may not have some correlation.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Uninterrupted flow in these channels is a goal of yogic practice. If the underlying scientific principles of the practice are not understood, yoga may be of little use.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Having shortened the stance, turn the right foot out 90&deg; and the left foot in approximately 45&deg;. If the left foot is turned in farther than 90&deg;, balance is easily lost, while if the left foot is not turned in sufficiently it is too difficult to square the hips &mdash; or if they are squared excess strain is placed on the left knee, since the tibia rotates outwardly and the femur rotates medially, following the movement of the pelvis. Now pin the right hip back by grounding the base of the right big toe, and draw the left hip forward by grounding the outside of the left foot, until the hips are square.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.q5pjc93as4ls"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.2dpkdllwf0vc"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Spinal Movement</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The lumbar spine is structurally unsuitable for twisting due to the orientation of its facet joints (L1&ndash;L5). Although twisting movements are limited in the lumbar spine, it has a great range of movement in flexion and extension (forward- and backbending respectively). In comparison, the orientation of the facet joints in the thoracic spine (T1&ndash;T11) allows ample rotation but limited extension. Extension is also limited here due to the direct attachment of the ribs onto the vertebral body and its transverse processes (twelve pairs of ribs attach to the twelve thoracic vertebrae).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">With the left hand, reach far forward beyond your right foot. Exhaling, lower the hand and place it on the outside edge of the right foot, with the little finger next to the little toe. The fingers are spread and point in the same direction as the toes. Maintain the lift of the heart by not flexing but rather continuing to lengthen the trunk. Draw your shoulder blades down the back and bring your heart through from between the shoulders. If this is not possible with the hand on the floor, place it on your foot or shin. The left hand pushes the floor away. The right fingertips reach up to the ceiling, where the gaze is focused. Beginners may gaze down to the foot if looking up makes them lose their balance.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It is important to keep both hip joints at an even distance from the floor. To achieve this, avoid leaning into the front (right) foot. Instead, pin the right hip back by grounding the roots of the toes of the right foot and engaging the abductors of the hip on the right side. These actions prevent the left hip from sagging.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 256.00px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image185.jpg" style="width: 256.00px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Parivrta Trikonasana</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Position the head above the front foot and continue lengthening the spine and neck in this direction.

Extend out through the big toe and at the same time create a suction of the thigh back into the hip. Counteract the forward tendency in the posture by keeping the heel of the back foot heavy. Counteract the hip flexion on the front leg by drawing the front foot on the ground toward you. Ideally, as the feet ground downward there is a continuous line of energy flowing up the legs, over the hips, along the spine, and up through the crown of the head. In this way the posture is grounded and, simultaneously, energy is drawn upward.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.z9snrejtiaeg"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Three</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Inhaling, return back up to the middle position.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.58v5co2nfcnq"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Four</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Repeat </span><span class="c0 c7">Parivrta Trikonasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;for five breaths on the left.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.oavnch7bnba6"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Five</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Inhaling, return to the middle position.

It is not a defining factor of the posture to have the femur parallel to the floor: this is achieved when the strength necessary to support such flexibility is developed. Place the right hand on the floor alongside the outside edge of the foot, with fingers pointing in the same direction as the toes. Keeping the base of the big toe grounded, the right knee presses against the right shoulder. This action engages the abductors of the right hip posture is neutralized. Keep tension between the bent knee and the opposite hip to work the groins open. The palm faces down to the floor and the left armpit faces out to the side (and not up to the ceiling). This is achieved by engaging the infraspinatus muscle, which laterally rotates the humerus (arm joint. At the same time, take the left arm over the head to form a diagonal line from the left foot all the way up to the left hand. Beginners may need to increase their stance at this point to achieve this line.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.g0vidapmrj8c"><span class="c19 c0">MYTHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.m4tndjttu1zj"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Perfect World</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Lord Subramaniam, second son of Lord Shiva, also known as Skanda the fierce lord of war, once went to visit Lord Shiva and complained that the current world, which was created by Lord Brahma, was imperfect &mdash; full of corruption, crime, and injustice. Shiva suggested that he create a better world. Subramaniam then defeated and incarcerated Brahma, and destroyed his world. Then he created his own, better world.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">After some time Lord Shiva visited Subramaniam and looked at his perfect world. In it nothing moved or lived or changed, as everything was arrested, frozen in the static state of perfection. There were not even sentient beings, as their essential nature is to strive for perfection and, if perfection is reached, life has come to an end. Liberated beings are not reborn. The Buddha, after reaching Mahaparinirvana, never came back. That is why </span><span class="c0 c7">bodhisattva</span><span class="c0">s avoid perfection: they are thus able to continue to serve others. According to Indian thought, the state of perfection exists only as consciousness, called </span><span class="c0 c7">purusha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0 c7">atman</span><span class="c0 c3">, which is the seat of awareness. What changes is the transitory world of manifestation, which includes body, mind, egoity, and all objects made up of the gross elements and subtle elementary particles.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Shiva pointed out to Subramaniam that this world was not a world at all, but only a frozen image of perfection. The purpose of a manifest world is to supply beings with the right cocktail of pleasure and pain, which eventually leads to self-knowledge. For this purpose it has to be in constant flux, and hence imperfect. Seeing the flaw in his world, Subramaniam freed Brahma to reinstall his old, imperfect world.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In this posture it is important not to collapse into the hips but to keep them supported. There should be a feeling of buoyancy in the hips and legs away from the floor. Ground the outer arch of the left foot and use it as an anchor to establish an outward rotation in the left thigh, which will lift the left hip back over the right. The right hip joint makes an attempt to dive through under the left one to stretch the right adductor group (see figure 17, page 101) in anticipation of the half-lotus and lotus postures to come.7 The right thigh rotates inward until the lateral rotation that brought us into the bone). This movement does not need to be performed by people whose arm is naturally in this position, which can be assessed by a qualified teacher. Indiscriminate outward rotation may lead to inflammation of the rotator cuff and an infraspinatus that is chronically in spasm.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Keep the shoulders down, away from the ears, by depressing the shoulder girdle using the latissimus dorsi muscle. The shoulder is kept up off the neck by abducting the shoulder blades with the serratus anterior muscle (see figure 9, page 48).

It inserts on the medial border of the scapula, the side that is close to the spine. As it contracts, the serratus anterior draws the shoulder blades out to the sides, thus widening the area behind the heart. This action is of prime importance. Serratus anterior also strongly contracts during </span><span class="c0 c7">Shirshasana, Urdhva Dhanurasana</span><span class="c0">, and handstand. It works together with the pectoralis minor in </span><span class="c0 c7">Chaturanga Dandasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, but is the prime mover of the shoulder girdle during the transition into Downward Dog and the jump back from the sitting postures.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The puffing out of the chest in standing postures is often achieved by contracting behind the heart. This action is performed by the rhomboid muscles. It represents an energetic closing and hardening, and can be counteracted by engaging serratus anterior.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Winged shoulder blades indicate a weakness of the serratus anterior muscle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 222.67px; height: 250.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image112.jpg" style="width: 222.67px; height: 250.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The head turns to face the raised arm, looking along the arm to gaze at the palm of the hand without contorting the neck.

The right foot is turned out 90&deg;. Keeping the back leg straight, again track the right knee over the right ankle. Squaring the hips, hook the left shoulder outside the right knee (the emptier the lungs are the easier this is). You can assist yourself by pressing the right thigh toward the center with your right hand. Press the left hand into the floor outside the foot, spreading the fingers.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Now take the right arm overhead to form a diagonal line from the left foot to the right hand. The palm faces downward, the face is turned toward the right arm, and the gaze is up toward the palm. Spread the base of the toes of the back foot to encourage the leg to be straight and strong. Strong abduction of the right knee, countered by the left arm, will inspire the spine to spiral.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Do not fake the spinal twist by letting your right hip sag toward the floor, but work the hips toward being level and square.

This is intelligent action.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Most muscles have more than one action. For example, latissimus dorsi primarily extends the humerus.8 It also medially rotates the humerus. The first of the two actions indirectly causes the arm to bend at the elbow. This is counteracted by the deltoid, which flexes the humerus (raises the arm above the head). The medial rotation of the humerus calls the infraspinatus into play. One action is played against its opposite to reach the desired balanced posture.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">For beginners who cannot enter the posture in one breath, it may be approached in phases:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Turn to face the right leg and place the left knee on the floor. Keeping the leg bent, hook the left shoulder outside the right knee and press the left hand into the floor.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Keeping the knee over the ankle and the shoulder hooked outside the knee, lift the back knee off the floor and straighten the leg.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Maintaining all of the above, work the left heel down, placing the foot at a 45&deg; angle.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Raise the right arm and gaze at the palm.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Stay at any of these phases for as long as necessary until the stage is attained.

The subtle alignment of the front foot is here probably more important than in any other standing posture. There needs to be a straight line going through the second toe and the center of the tibia and femur, with both bones in neutral rotation. The common tendency is to turn the front foot out too much, which rotates the tibia and femur away from each other. Pin the right hip back by grounding the right big toe. The entire thigh of the front leg is sucked back into the hip by engaging the quadriceps and the hamstrings. Without lifting the heel of the foot off the floor, point the toes. This action also engages the hamstrings, which serves to protect them in this intense stretch.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">There is a strong tendency here to lean into the front foot, which causes the left hip to sag down to the floor. This avoids the stretch of the right hamstrings. Counteract this tendency by casting weight back into the left foot, spiking down the back heel. Keep the hips square and at an even distance from the floor. The back leg is straight and active, with an emphasis on grounding the outer arch of the foot. Gentle inward rolling of the thigh supports the squaring of the hips. All rotational movements need to be individually assessed by a teacher with knowledge of anatomy, as they can easily be overdone.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The elbows and shoulders have a tendency to droop forward and are lifted by the action of the rhomboid muscles, which lie between the shoulder blades. The palms, especially the roots of the fingers, press together. The entire trunk still performs </span><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0 c3">, with the spine, neck, and back of the head in line as if standing upright. Allow neither the forehead to collapse to the shin nor the chin to jut forward to meet the shin. Instead, encourage the crown of the head and the heart to reach forward toward the front big toe, while the shoulder blades and sit bones draw backward, thereby putting the entire spine into traction.

It lengthens the hamstrings over the hip joint &mdash; here check that the right hip has not been lifted with the leg and deepen the groin by releasing the psoas.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.t5qo7zw3jp17"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.4bdvjdq9f4sc"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Strengthening the Feet</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Beginners often develop cramps in their feet, especially if they have fallen arches. This should not be discouraging. Cramping indicates a weakness of the foot, but this will quickly be corrected through this posture if it is performed correctly. This is important, as fallen arches stress the medial meniscus and eventually weaken the knee joint. To correct this we have to lift the inner and transverse arches away from the floor. The anatomical names for these actions are plantar flexion (pointing the foot) and inversion of the foot (turning the sole of the foot upward) respectively. We will return to this action again and again, as it is the same one that protects the knee on entering into the half and full lotus postures. The muscles that perform both actions are tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. All three originate on the tibia and fibula and insert on the underside of the foot.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Establish the support of the standing leg by grounding the base of its big toe. The subtle medial spiraling achieved in the leg indicates the awakening of the abductor muscles. When you are standing on one leg, these muscles are vital in supporting the suspended hip and leg.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The right hand reaches down the outside of the knee and &ldquo;binds&rdquo; the right big toe, that is, wraps two fingers around it. Place the left hand on the left hip. Now straighten the right leg, but only to a point where the back can be held upright. Sacrificing the alignment of the spine defies yogic principles. With the leg straight, lift it high and lengthen out through the inseam11 of both legs. If the right shoulder has been pulled forward by the weight of the leg, draw it back until the shoulders are again square.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 450.67px; height: 170.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image99.jpg" style="width: 450.67px; height: 170.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Utthita Hasta Padangushtasana, vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;one (left), </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;two, </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;four, and </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;seven</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.9si5qhw939ng"><span class="c19 c0">YOGIC CONTEXT</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.algseu42pbso"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Outer Structure and Inner Freedom</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Yoga Sutra</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;II.47 says that the posture is correctly performed when the effort to perform it develops a quality of emptiness.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">What does this mean? Initially effort is necessary. Otherwise the gross body, which is tamasic by nature,9 will never become vibrant and alive in every aspect of the posture. Once the outer frame of the posture is achieved, we need to meditate on the inner nature of effort.

Both aspects of this duality must be embraced; both need to be experienced.

The hip is often pulled up to escape the hamstring stretch. Check that the standing leg is still straight. Grow tall and elongate the spine up to the ceiling as the sit bones descend to the floor.

The foot is taken out to the side as far as possible and the right hip joint worked open.

Let go of the foot and hold the leg up away from the floor. This is an important exercise for strengthening the psoas muscle (see figure 12, page 67). This action is initiated by the psoas and completed by the rectus femoris (hip flexor). Due to its origin (anterior superior iliac spine), it tends to tilt the pelvis anteriorly (forward). A tight/weak psoas also has the tendency to exaggerate the lordosis of the low back (swayback). Both of these tendencies need to be counteracted by the rectus abdominis muscle (see figure 16, page 89), which pulls the pubic bone up in front and tilts the pelvis posteriorly.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">If the abdominal muscles do not work, the leg cannot be lifted very high. </span><span class="c0 c7">Utthita Hasta Padangushtasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is an optimal exercise for both the hip flexors and the abdominal muscles.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 398.67px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image85.jpg" style="width: 398.67px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.xy7cw4safags"><span class="c19 c0">FIGURE 10: ABDUCTORS</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The muscles that draw the right foot out to the side and stretch the adductor muscles are their antagonists, the abductors. This muscle group consists of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia latae. All three are situated on the outside of the hip. The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus both originate just below the crest of the ilium on the outside of the hip and insert on the mount of the femur, called the greater trochanter. The anterior fibers of the gluteus medius internally rotate the femur while the posterior fibers externally rotate the femur as the muscle abducts. The gluteus minimus internally rotates as it abducts, and the tensor fascia latae internally rotates as it flexes and abducts the femur.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The abductors are important during walking, as they prevent the opposite hip from sagging.

Only then can the two bones move as a unity in the posture, which avoids any strain on the knee joint. If you cannot perform this movement, you should not attempt to go all the way into the posture, but concentrate instead on preparation. If you cannot completely close the knee joint you need to lengthen the quadriceps. Long quadriceps are also of great advantage in backbending.</span></p><h3 class="c32 c12" id="h.qh9z8acvslrw"><span class="c25 c3">PHASE 2</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Pick up the right foot and, cradling it in both hands, point and invert it. Now direct the knee far out to the side. Gently draw the foot up into the </span><span class="c0 c7">right</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;groin, with the knee still out to the side. This educates the hip to perform lateral rotation. The main prerequisite for the lotus and half-lotus postures is the ability to rotate the femur in the hip joint, and resistance may be encountered here. It is important to realize that the half-lotus and lotus postures belong to a group that involve hip rotation and not knee rotation. If we do not open the hip joints (which are ball-and-socket joints and move in all directions), the &ldquo;opening&rdquo; will go into the knee joints. These are, however, hinge joints, designed to move in only one direction. The &ldquo;opening&rdquo; will be nothing but a destabilization.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The ancient yogis had no problems in this area: they always sat on the floor, which keeps the hip joints mobile and flexible. In our society we sit in chairs off the floor and with the hip joints flexed. We therefore need to invest extra time into postures that prepare us for the Primary Series.</span></p><h3 class="c12 c32" id="h.winhtqpf8hj9"><span class="c25 c3">PHASE 3</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">From having the knee pointed far out to the right and the right heel in the right groin, we now lift the heel toward the navel, keeping foot and knee the same distance from the floor.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If you closed the gap between tibia and femur, both bones will now move as a unity, preventing any strain on the knee joint. I like to refer to this knee position as &ldquo;sealed.&rdquo; It ensures that the rotation happens between the femur and its hip socket (acetabulum) and not between the femur and the tibia (knee joint). When you have acquired the necessary hip rotation, you will be able to touch your heel to your navel.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 389.33px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image73.jpg" style="width: 389.33px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h3 class="c32 c12" id="h.5zl9kz42i2fl"><span class="c25 c3">PHASE 4</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Keeping the heel in line with the navel, let the knee slide down toward the floor. Ideally at this point we would medially rotate the femur to an extent that the previous lateral rotation is annulled, and the sole of the foot faces forward instead of upward. Lift the right foot into the opposite groin, making sure the heel stays in line with the navel. Keep hold of the foot with the left hand while the right hand reaches around your back for the left elbow. Bind the elbow or if possible the big toe of the right foot. Check that there is no limitation here from failing to lift the shoulder as the arm reaches back. Now draw the shoulder blade down the back.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Only when you have managed to bind the big toe with the opposite hand can you safely proceed to fold forward. The ability to bind indicates that the knee is in a safe position to fold forward. If the toe cannot be bound, the foot is probably not high enough in the groin but rather somewhere on the opposite thigh. This means that the knee joint is not flexed completely and the ligamentous structures and cartilage will be subject to stress.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 400.00px; height: 536.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image34.jpg" style="width: 400.00px; height: 536.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 350.67px; height: 422.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image183.jpg" style="width: 350.67px; height: 422.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.x24ez3rgmuw1"><span class="c19 c0">PRACTICAL TIP</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.q4ng0exxyp8i"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Lengthening the Quadriceps</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The easiest way to lengthen the quadriceps is to spend fifteen minutes or longer each day engaged in </span><span class="c0 c7">Virasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and, later, </span><span class="c0 c7">Supta Virasana</span><span class="c0">.

The head priest, Daksha, was an orthodox rule-maker and preserver of traditional society. Against his consent, his beautiful daughter Sati married Lord Shiva. Shiva destroys the world at the end of each world age, and he also destroys the ego. He is therefore the Lord of Mystery.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">For various reasons Daksha considered Shiva impure. Shiva had peculiar habits such as meditating in burial grounds smeared with the ashes of the dead, and meditating on mountaintops for long periods, rather than participating in society. But the main reason for Daksha&rsquo;s disdain was that Shiva always carried a skull with him. The story behind this was that, to punish him for his vanity, Shiva had once cut off one of the five heads of Lord Brahma, whereupon Brahma laid a curse on Shiva: that the skull would stick to his hand. To this day some worshipers of Shiva always carry with them a skull.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">At one time Daksha organized a great ceremony to which he invited all deities and dignitaries with the exception of Shiva and Sati. Against Shiva&rsquo;s advice, Sati attended her father&rsquo;s ceremony. Before the thousands of guests she asked her father why he had not invited her husband. Daksha responded by exclaiming that Shiva was a despicable character, an outcast who did not know the conventions of society.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">With this insult to her husband, Sati&rsquo;s anger was so aroused that she burst into flames and was reduced to ashes. When Shiva, in his solitude, heard of Sati&rsquo;s death he became terribly angry, jumped up and danced the dance of destruction.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Eventually he tore out one of his </span><span class="c0 c7">jatar</span><span class="c0 c3">s (dreadlocks) and smashed it to the ground. From the impact the terrible warriors Virabhadra and Bhadrakali arose. Shiva ordered them to proceed to Daksha&rsquo;s festival, destroy the hall, kill everybody one by one, behead Daksha, drink his blood, and throw his head into the fire.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The story continues, but as far as our posture is concerned we can leave it there. </span><span class="c0 c7">Virabhadrasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is dedicated to this terrible warrior.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c13 c12" id="h.9m8trleucci9"><span class="c17 c7"></span></h1><h1 class="c18 c12" id="h.k2wmdy1e58ke"><span>Paschimottanasana</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">INTENSE WESTERN STRETCH</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Drishti</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;Toes</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">As with all following </span><span class="c0 c7">asana</span><span class="c0">s (excluding the finishing postures), here we pick up the </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;count at seven.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.l0a8ehgxyqyo"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Seven</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Inhaling, jump through to a seated position.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">At first you may execute this movement using momentum. With increased proficiency you will be able to jump through with little or no momentum while still clearing the floor. The key to effortless performance here is to connect the breath to the </span><span class="c0 c7">bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">s. As long as we are airborne in the jump, we must continue to inhale, as the inhalation has a lifting and carrying effect. Once the lift-through is complete we initiate the exhalation to lower down.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">To learn this movement it should be divided into two clearly distinguishable separate phases. Phase 1 is hopping forward into an arm balance with the shoulders over the wrists, and the hips and folded legs lifted high. Phase 2 consists of letting the torso and legs slowly swing through the arms, using the shoulders as an axis. As you swing through, suck the feet up into the abdomen and the knees into the chest to clear the floor. With the last of the inhalation, straighten the legs into </span><span class="c0 c7">Dandasana</span><span class="c0">, still suspended in the air. With the exhalation, slowly lower down like a helicopter. Performing the movement in this way will establish a firm connection between breath and </span><span class="c0 c7">bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">s. It will also strengthen the abdomen and the low back, preparing for the challenging backbends and leg-behind-head postures in the later sequences.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Sit in </span><span class="c0 c7">Dandasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for five breaths. </span><span class="c0 c7">Dandasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has no </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;count of its own: rather, the seventh </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the state of </span><span class="c0 c7">Dandasana</span><span class="c0">.

The sit bones ground and the spine lengthens with the attempt to reproduce its natural curvature. The heart is lifted and buoyant, open in the front and broad and open in the back. The armpits lift in the front as the tops of the arm bones (humerus) are positioned in the center of the shoulder joints. Extend the arms and place the hands on the floor with the fingers pointing toward the feet. If your arms are longer than your torso, place the hands slightly behind the hips. The kneecaps are pulled up. Lengthen out through the base of the toes and spike the heels down into the floor to awaken the hamstrings.

The low back must be kept flat. To round the back in a seated forward bend is the equivalent of bending down from a standing position to lift a heavy object off the floor while rounding the back and keeping the legs straight. To avoid the danger of disc bulge and prolapse (see page 37, and figure 6, page 38) it is necessary to keep the low back straight in any weight-bearing situation. This includes all forward bending postures and also leg-behind-head postures like </span><span class="c0 c7">Ekapada Shirshasana</span><span class="c0">. In postures where gravity is the only load, such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Karnapidasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and</span><span class="c0 c7">Bujapidasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, the spine can be safely flexed.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Without resorting to bending your back and/or using a strap, you have two options if you are too stiff to reach the big toes in </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">. One is to bend the knees and take the toes. This enables the pelvis to tilt forward, which is the imperative first stage of a forward bend. Keeping the iliac crests (upper front of the hip bones) in close proximity to the thighs, work on slowly straightening out the legs. Press out through the base of the feet and, at the same time, reach the sit bones away from the feet. The pubic bone slips down between the thighs. The other option is to take hold of the shins, ankles, or whatever you can reach. With a firm grip, slowly work your way forward as the hamstrings lengthen.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Some students will find their hamstrings so stiff that the pelvis tilts posteriorly when sitting on the floor with legs straight. This means that gravity is working against you. In this case, it is advisable to elevate the sit bones by sitting on a folded blanket. This helps to bring the pelvis upright, enabling proper alignment of the spine. Whichever approach you choose, with the inhalation lift the chest and straighten the arms.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.jbeb8hdqln2s"><span class="c19 c0">YOGIC CONTEXT</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.ub3ks1xvcfb0"><span class="c0 c20 c7">The Use of Props</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0">All </span><span class="c0 c7">asana</span><span class="c0">s are designed to form energetic cycles &mdash; especially postures like </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottan asana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Padmasana</span><span class="c0">, where the hands are connected to the feet. The earth, being receptive, draws out our energy. These bound postures recycle energy that is otherwise lost. Yogis often meditate on a seat that consists of consecutive layers of </span><span class="c0 c7">kusha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grass, deer or tiger skin, and cotton to insulate them from the earth. These energy cycles are thought to have a profound influence on the pranic sheath (</span><span class="c0 c7">pranamaya kosha</span><span class="c0 c3">), which is reduced when the energy flow is interrupted through belts and straps.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The use of a strap or belt might seem like an easy solution for students with stiff ham-strings who find it difficult to reach their toes with their back straight. However, as Shri K. Pattabhi Jois has pointed out, the use of props interrupts the energy cycle of the posture.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Look up between your eyebrows as you pull up on your kneecaps, and draw your shoulder blades down your back. Lengthen your waist, letting the lower ribs reach away from your hip bones by releasing the psoas muscle. The psoas is the only muscle that connects the lower extremities to the spine, which makes it an integral stabilizing core muscle.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.wvsv4049fwi5"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.n11dw5oran1f"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Psoas &mdash; The Seat of the Soul</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The hip flexor muscle group includes the rectus femoris of the quadriceps, the sartorius, the tensor fascia latae, and the deeply internal psoas muscle. Continuing to contract the rectus femoris after it has tilted the hips in a forward bend causes it to bunch up in the front of the hip and prevent one from working deeper into the posture. The psoas muscle originates from the sides of the body of T12 (the last thoracic vertebra), where it touches the diaphragm and all five lumbar vertebrae. It runs along the back of the abdominal cavity (the front of the spine) through the pelvis and inserts at a mount on the inside of the thighbone (femur), the lesser trochanter. It flexes the hip joint and laterally rotates the femur in the process.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">When the thigh is fixed, as in standing and seated postures, the psoas is flexed. Ida Rolf states that a healthy psoas should elongate during flexion and fall back toward the spine.13 It is necessary to release and lengthen the psoas, once the hips are tilted forward, in order to deepen any forward-bending postures.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The superficial muscles of the body relax completely after they have been worked, but the deep muscles always retain a certain tension, even at rest. This is especially true of muscles that originate on the spine, like the psoas. They are therefore prone to spasm if worked intensely. The conscious relaxing of these muscles is as important as exercising them.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The psoas is the deepest muscle in the body. Its importance is such that it has been described by some as the &ldquo;seat of the soul.&rdquo; To see the psoas in action one has to imagine the graceful gait of African or Indian women carrying large water containers on their heads. To do this, the head has to maintain a continuous forward motion without any sudden jerks. The movement is only possible with a strong but relaxed psoas muscle. The psoas swings the pelvis forward and backward like a cradle. This swinging action initiates the movement of the legs with the rectus femoris (the large hip flexor at the front of the thigh) only coming into action well after the psoas. The swinging of the pelvis creates a wavelike motion up the spine, which keeps the spine healthy and vibrant, and the mind centered in the heart. If you have ever tried to walk with a large object balancing on your head you know how difficult this makes it to follow the tangents of the mind. Connecting with the core of the body (the psoas) shifts the attention from the mind to the heart &mdash; this is why the psoas is regarded as the seat of the soul.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The other extreme can be observed when we watch an army march. Soldiers are required to keep the psoas hardened. Being constantly shortened, the muscle spasms and is weakened. In the military attention posture, when the chest is swelled, one naturally dips into the low back, which also weakens the psoas muscle. When marching, the pelvis is arrested and the thighs are aggressively thrust upward and forward. This movement only uses the rectus femoris. The spine is frozen, and this keeps the soldiers&rsquo; attention in their minds. In this state the mind can more easily be convinced to be noncompassionate to fellow human beings, who are instead labeled as the enemy.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If we all walked with our psoas active and our spines caressed with the wavelike motion this produces, our minds would possibly arrive at a state of silence. We would then see every human being as part of the same consciousness that animates us all. One of the reasons our Western culture has conquered much of the world with its arms is that we have abandoned natural awareness and have fallen under the tyranny of the mind. Yoga calls for restoring this awareness, which draws us to naturally abide in nonviolence. Nonviolence becomes a nonimposed ethical law.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">As one starts practicing yoga it is very important to abandon the Western aggressive conquering attitude of wanting to derive an advantage out of yoga, but rather to approach the postures from a deep surrender into what is already here. All forward bends inspire this attitude. If, rather than developing yet another wish &mdash; such as to lengthen the hamstrings, which actually shorten and contract with greed &mdash; we let go into the knowledge that everything we may ask for is already here, the hamstrings will release by themselves. Ambition shortens hamstrings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 390.67px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image138.jpg" style="width: 390.67px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.aa32mk370fbn"><span class="c19 c0">FIGURE 12: PSOAS AND ILIACUS</span></h4><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 200.00px; height: 217.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image187.jpg" style="width: 200.00px; height: 217.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.2ne3xyrqbk7z"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Nine</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Exhaling, fold forward at the hip joints, maintaining the lift created in </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;eight.

Do not breathe excessively into the belly, as is often done in forward bending, but encourage the rib cage to participate in the breathing process.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The inhalation is used to reach the heart forward, whereas the exhalation is used by surrendering deeper into the posture. If this instruction leads to the student &ldquo;bouncing&rdquo; up and down in the posture, we can conclude that </span><span class="c0 c7">Uddiyana Bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is not engaged sufficiently. Let these movements be motivated from deep within, working the posture from the core out toward the periphery.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The kneecaps are permanently lifted in all forward-bending postures. As explained in </span><span class="c0 c7">Padangushtasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(page 37), the antagonist of each muscle to be stretched needs to be engaged. The muscle group being stretched here is the hamstrings; their antagonist is the quadriceps. For beginners it is often impossible to keep the kneecaps pulled up due to an inability to access the quadriceps. It may seem as if we need to grow a new nerve connection to this muscle. This learned coordination is possible through concentration and perseverance. The teacher may gently press the thumbs into both thighs to &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; the quadriceps.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In all forward bends it is important to release and spread the buttocks. The buttocks are often tightened in a fear response to the stretch felt. Tightening the buttocks, however, draws us up out of the forward bend since the gluteus maximus muscle is a hip extensor. The ligaments of the sacroiliac joints (sacrum/pelvis joints) can also be strained. Focus on releasing the buttocks, allowing them to spread, and lengthen through the low back. This is eccentric lengthening of the quadratus lumborum muscle. Eccentric lengthening means that the muscle is active, as we need it to keep the back straight, but at the same time it becomes longer as we elongate the waist. In other words the muscles lengthen against resistance. It is important to create additional space between the hipbone and the lowest rib because a shortened, contracted waist is an obstacle in all forward bending, backbending, and leg-behind-head postures.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 450.67px; height: 292.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image59.jpg" style="width: 450.67px; height: 292.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A (the state of the </span><span class="c0 c7">asana</span><span class="c0 c3">)</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The shoulders move away from the ears in </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">. Contracting the trapezius and levator scapulae muscles hunches the shoulders around the ears and blocks the flow of energy to the cervical spine. Excessive contracting of the neck muscles can lead to a red face in forward or back bending, which indicates a constriction of the blood flow to the head. Use the anchoring of the hands to counteract this, by drawing the shoulder blades down the back, which is called depressing the shoulder girdle (latissimus dorsi), and by drawing them out to the sides, called abduction of the scapulae (serratus anterior).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is another great posture to demonstrate the principle of simultaneous expansion in opposing directions. The feet, the heart, and the crown of the head are reaching forward to elongate the spine. The shoulder blades, the sit bones, and the heads of the femurs are extending backward. The elbows and the shoulder blades reach out wide to the sides. The muscles hug the body, compressing</span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;into the core. The core remains open, receptive, and bright. Its luminescence permeates the whole of the posture and shines forth.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Surrender is most important in </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">. This posture is not about conquering the hamstrings but about letting go. To breathe into and release the hamstrings can be very upsetting. We store many powerful emotions, such as suppressed anger, competitiveness, and fear of inadequacy, in our hamstring muscles. All suppressed emotions are potentially crippling to our health: they are toxic and have an impact on our personality. It is essential that, if strong emotions do arise when we breathe awareness into the hamstrings, we acknowledge whatever we feel and then let go of these emotions. Breathing through a posture requires that the stretch be kept at a manageable intensity. If the stretch is too strong we will harden and numb ourselves further. One needs to stretch with compassion and intelligence. Otherwise, instead of letting go of our old unconscious conditioning, we will superimpose yet another layer of abuse.

In the first, the foot is flexed (dorsal flexed), which means that the upper side of the foot is drawn toward the shin. This position can be used for the less intense type of forward bends &mdash; for postures where the hamstrings do not bear the weight of the torso, such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Dandasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">Marichyasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;C.14</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The second foot position, the one used in </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">, is between pointing and flexing.

Keeping the feet flexed in </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is one of the main sources of hamstring injuries.

The rotation pattern is as follows:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; </span><span class="c0 c7">Ardha Baddha Padma Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;&mdash; medial rotation</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; </span><span class="c0 c7">Triang Mukha Ekapada Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;&mdash; lateral rotation</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;A &mdash; medial rotation</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;B &mdash; lateral rotation</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;C &mdash; medial rotation</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.5525b4kpguuf"><span class="c19 c0">ANATOMICAL FOCUS</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.1e1qihqq4tyr"><span class="c0 c20 c7">The Paradox of Active Release</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This is an important understanding that needs to be grasped in order to master the art of working deeply and harmoniously in all postures. Active release derives its effectiveness from the following principle: To enter a posture we use prime muscle groups that perform particular actions. Once in the posture, we must release those muscle groups and engage their antagonists to work harmoniously and more deeply into the posture.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">For example, to go into a backbend we engage the trunk extensors (erector spinae, quadratus lumborum). Ultimately, however, these muscles limit backbending. They shorten the back and pinch the spinous processes of the vertebrae together. Once we have arrived in a backbend we need to release the trunk extensors and instead engage the trunk flexors (abdominal muscles). This lengthens the back, creates space between the spinous processes, and deepens the backbend.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The same principle is applied in hip rotations such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Ardha Baddha Padma Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Konasana</span><span class="c0">. We laterally rotate the femur to go into hip rotations, but when in the posture we release the lateral rotators by medially rotating the femur. This action takes us much deeper into the posture. In all forward bends such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;we engage the hip flexors, particularly the psoas and rectus femoris, to go into the posture. Once the hip joint is flexed to about 160&deg; we won&rsquo;t be able to close the joint any farther because the bulging hip flexors are in the way. To illustrate, try out the following: Standing, bend the knee joint by merely contracting the hamstrings and the calf muscles. You will not be able to close the joint completely because the very muscles that perform the action also prevent its completion. Now use your hand to draw your heel to your buttock. At the same time resist your hand by gently attempting to straighten your leg. This slight leg extension, performed by the antagonists of the prime movers, will release and flatten out the leg flexors so that the joint can now be completely closed.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">In the case of </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;the principle of active release is applied by drawing the heels down into the floor. This engages the hamstrings and enables the psoas and rectus femoris to release. Once they are released the front of the hip joint can be fully closed and the forward bend completed.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This action does not mean the kneecaps will be released. The quadriceps, which pulls up the kneecaps, has four heads, rectus femoris being only one of them. If rectus femoris (the only two-joint muscle in the group) is released, the other three heads (vastus lateralis, medialis, and intermedius) can still pull up the kneecap and work to extend the leg.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">These femur rotations refer to the action performed after one has arrived in the posture. To get into the posture the action is the opposite. When the rotation pattern is performed in this way, the more challenging postures in the series, such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Marichyasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;D and </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Konasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, become easily accessible.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.md5yggwmp93r"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Seven</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Inhaling, jump through to sitting and straighten the legs. An experienced practitioner would go into the posture in one breath. For the sake of precision and safety we will break this rather complex movement down into various phases, identical to the standing half lotus (</span><span class="c0 c7">Ardha Baddha Padmottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">).</span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.wycj7967w8wy"><span class="c25 c3">PHASE 1</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Sitting in </span><span class="c0 c7">Dandasana</span><span class="c0">, flex the right knee joint completely until your right heel touches the right buttock.

You are now in the position for </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;A (page 79). Transiting through this posture on the way into half lotus prepares the adductor muscle group. Keeping the foot pointed and inverted, draw the knee far out to the right to further stretch the adductors. Tight adductors constitute the main obstacle to lotus and half-lotus postures. This method gives beginners maximum opening. It is not recommended that beginners pull the foot into position without first releasing the adductors. This movement can be repeated several times to produce the desired effect.</span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.losjngc1sxtb"><span class="c25 c3">PHASE 3</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Draw the heel in toward the navel.

Reach your right arm around your back to bind the right big toe. The palm faces downward. The palm facing up would lead to excessive inward rotation of the humerus and, with it, hunching of the shoulder. An inability to bind is often due to stiffness in the right shoulder because of a short pectoralis minor muscle (see figure 13, page 76). In this case reach the right arm far up and out to the right side. Spin the arm inward so that the palm faces backward. Reach far behind, lowering the hand. Abduct and depress the shoulder girdle to avoid jutting the shoulder forward. As you proceed, release the muscle that draws the shoulder forward (pectoralis minor). If you still cannot reach the toe, work intelligently in </span><span class="c0 c7">Parshvottanasana</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">Prasarita Padottanasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;C,</span><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Dhanurasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, and Upward and Downward Dog.

The straight left leg works in the same way as the legs in </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">. To place the right foot into the left groin we performed outward (lateral) rotation of the thigh. To work in the posture, we now medially rotate the thigh. To aid medial rotation, keep the right foot pointed and inverted. The muscles that inwardly rotate &mdash; two hamstrings (semimembranous, semitendinous) an adductor (gracilis), an abductor (gluteus minimus), and a hip flexor cum abductor (tensor fascia latae) &mdash; all have the tendency to suck the thigh into the hip. This can lead to a build-up of tension in the knee.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To counteract this, let the femur reach outward and away from the hip. This action releases the adductors, and its importance cannot be overemphasized.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Continue to gently draw the knee down to the floor and out to the side.

All six lateral hip rotators insert into the greater trochanter of the femur.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Since the pelvis is suspended like a hammock by the lateral rotators, any irregularity between the two sides will result in the pelvis not being level.

Point and invert the right foot, as this aids subsequent medial rotation of the femur. Draw the right heel into the right groin, thus completely sealing the knee joint.

This fundamental movement can be applied in all lotus postures. It will lead to sitting in lotus posture with the heels and the soles of the feet facing upward, as in depictions of the Buddha. This is the anatomically correct position. The position adopted by many Westerners, in which the heels and soles face toward the abdomen, places undue strain on the knee joints.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To invert the foot at the same time as pointing it deepens the medial spiraling of the thigh, thereby deepening the lotus position. Combining these actions, create a vector of energy out from the groin. This counteracts the tendency for beginners to suck the thigh back into the hip, which shortens the adductors and creates an obstacle to opening the hips. All hip rotations require that the adductors are released and lengthened.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Lengthening along the insides of the thighs in </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;A loosens the adductors and reduces pressure on the knee.

Our culture trains us to govern and to subdue nature; we place ourselves above nature. This is reflected in our habit of sitting on chairs &mdash; above the earth and removed from it. Asians and those of many other civilizations sat on the ground. This corresponded to a view in which humans are a part of nature and not its lord. And sitting on the ground leaves the hip joints open.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.jj5e2cu3jdyc"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Eight</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Exhaling, fold forward squarely over the inseam of the straight leg.

The thigh rolls forward (rotates medially) and reaches back until a state of equilibrium is achieved. Every movement needs to contain its countermovement. In the present case the inward rotation of the thigh is terminated by a corresponding outward rotation, when the neutral state is reached. To prevent the excessive performance of a movement, receptivity is necessary to recognize the neutral state. Work for five breaths in the posture. Both shoulders are kept at an even distance from the floor.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;A beautifully lengthens the quadratus lumborum, a small back extensor muscle in the low back.

It may be necessary to lift the left buttock off the floor to bring the knee down. With the aid of gravity, the lifted buttock will in time meet the floor. To reach the knee to the floor with muscular action would require contracting the hamstrings, which is contraindicated in this posture as it sucks the thigh back into the hip joint.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Take your time with this posture. If necessary stay weeks or months in any of the phases described above. Done correctly, the posture is very therapeutic for the knees, and it can cure chronic knee inflammation.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If you could follow the instructions so far, reach forward to bind the left foot. Flexible students can take the right wrist with the left hand.

Continue to medially rotate the thigh here. While the right knee keeps contact with the floor, the left sit bone sinks down to meet the floor. Continue to flex the right foot, drawing it deeper into the left groin. The heel should press into the lower abdomen. In females the heel presses into the uterus. This posture is especially therapeutic for the female reproductive system, just as </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;B is therapeutic for the male reproductive system.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The left foot is between a flexed and a pointed position, with the underneath of the leg actively working.

It is very challenging for those with tight hamstrings. The tendency here is to avoid taking weight into the bent leg, but to be propelled instead over onto the straight leg. This defeats the very challenge of the posture: to soften the hip of the bent leg. This posture prepares the hips for the </span><span class="c0 c7">Kurmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">s.

The pain is caused by excessive inversion of the ankle, which in turn is brought about by lack of medial rotation of the femur. All lotus and half-lotus postures need to be performed with a medially rotated femur. If this is not done due to a dormant hip joint, then often the knee joint, but in this case the ankle joint, will bear the brunt. The solution is to first avoid the inversion of the ankle by using the peroneus group on the outside of the leg. The everting action of the peronei will return the foot to a pointed, neutral position. The creative tension ensuing has now to be directed into the hip joint, and the femur medially rotated. If this is not possible, study medial rotation more closely in the previous postures.

The thoracic spine (upper back) from vertebra T1 to T12 is designed to twist. Here, the angle of the facet joints facilitates the greatest amount of rotation possible along the entire spine. Most of the twisting action is performed here. Twisting stretches the intercostal muscles, which lie between the ribs. As tight intercostal muscles are one of the main limitations to backbending, twists are an ideal preparation for it. The lumbar spine, which is very pliable in the forward- and backbending directions, is limited in its ability to twist. This provides necessary stability. Excessive twisting of the lumbar spine can destabilize the low back, so un-square the hips in seated twists and instead direct the twist into the upper back.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.qgdtd8gi5eam"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Seven</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Inhaling, jump through and enter </span><span class="c0 c7">Marichyasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;C on the same count.

Among other reasons, it can be caused by tight hip flexor muscles, mainly the psoas. This tendency can only be counteracted by a strong rectus abdominis muscle, which forms the outermost layer of the abdominals. The abdominals perform trunk flexion and twisting. The rectus abdominis originates at the crest of the pubic bone and inserts at the sternum (xiphoid process) and the rib cage (5th to 7th ribs).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Successively deeper layers of the abdominals consist of the external and internal oblique abdominis muscles, which primarily twist and secondarily flex the trunk.

On the floor, make another attempt to bring your knees right up on to your shoulders. The legs need to be almost parallel, without a gap between the inner thighs and the sides of the rib cage.

Most mishaps in lotus posture happen when the second leg, here the left leg, is forced into position. The most precarious way to place the second foot is to bend the leg only to 90&deg; and transit the foot over the right knee to bring it into position. Even flexible students damage their knees with this method.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To protect the knees in lotus and half-lotus postures, first close the knee joint completely, bringing tibia and femur close together. Then move them both as one unit. This method eliminates lateral movement in the knee, which is responsible for meniscus injuries.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">To protect the knee of the second leg, visualize </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;as being two half-lotus postures united. This means that we follow the same steps for the half-lotus posture with the second leg, completely ignoring the fact that the right leg is already in half lotus. Try the following steps:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Point and invert the left foot.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Draw the left heel toward the left groin, closing the knee joint completely.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; In therapy situations, first place the left foot under the right ankle. Only proceed further if this position is comfortable. Still keeping the knee joint closed, draw the left knee as far out to the side as possible without moving the sit bones. Gently lift your foot over the right ankle toward the navel.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; From here, draw the foot across into the right groin.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If the movement is performed in this way, the knee joint is completely closed at all times, which means that, on the left side also, the tibia and femur move as a unity. If you experience pain in the knees at any point, reverse the movement to a point were you are pain free and proceed more slowly, paying attention to detail.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Practice the other postures until you have gained the necessary flexibility.</span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.5a91kwh8i7bv"><span class="c25 c3">PHASE 3</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c0">To prepare for </span><span class="c0 c7">Garbha Pindasana</span><span class="c0">, medially rotate the femurs until the front edges of the tibias point down to the floor and the soles and heels face upward and not toward the torso.

Now point the feet, which leads to the heels moving apart from each other. This lengthens the insides of the thighs. The heels then reach toward the respective groins, which prevents the sit bones from escaping backward as we fold forward. The most important action, however, is the inward rotation of the thighs. The thigh bones should roll forward like the wheels of a cart (with the floor as a reference point). The thigh bonehas to inwardly rotate in </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Konasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to perform the same action as the tibia, which will close and protect the knee joint. The tibia rolls forward until its front edge points straight down.

Finally, let the thigh bones reach out to the side, a movement that will release the adductors. This isometric movement was initiated already by pointing the feet and separating the heels. Often there is a fear reflex here to suck the thigh bones into the hip joints. This action is, however, performed by the adductors, and will prevent you from opening into the posture.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">What prevents most students from going deeply into this posture is chronic tension of the adductors. This is often due to emotions such as fear, pain, and shame held on to in these muscles. These emotions need to be acknowledged and then released with the exhalation. In order to do that, the intensity of the sensation in the posture needs to be still tolerable. If one overstretches one&rsquo;s muscles, a trauma is stored in the tissue. The muscles will prevent one from going again to that point as a mere protective mechanism.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The trunk actions for </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Konasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are the same as for </span><span class="c0 c7">Janushirshasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A and </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashimottanasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;&mdash; drawing in the lower abdomen, lifting the heart forward, drawing the shoulder blades down the back, and letting the crown of the head and the sit bones reach into opposing directions. Press the elbows against the inner thighs to keep the knees grounded. Draw the feet toward you while they maintain their action of pointing and inverting.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">If your sit bones lift off and escape backward in the process of folding forward, counteract this by sucking your heels into the abdomen using breath and abdominal muscles. The abdominals can do that by drawing the abdominal contents vigorously in against the spine, which lets the heart leap forward and creates a vacuum into which the heels are sucked. Finally place the toes on the chest, wearing them like a necklace. Stay in the state of </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Konasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;for five breaths.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.okq8c53fon8h"><span class="c19 c0">PRACTICAL TIP</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.bxdk5bp9q9sx"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Tips for Different Skin Types</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Practitioners with </span><span class="c0 c7">vata</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;skin,17 which is rather thin, papery, and silken, and easily slips on cloth material, will generally find no problem with wearing long tights.

This action is necessary to counteract the opposite tendency (lateral rotation of the thigh), which avoids stretching and lengthening the adductor muscles of the inner thigh.

This is a compensation for stiffness in the quadriceps and/or psoas muscles. By opening into the inseams of the legs, more space is gained without having to stretch the hip flexors. Although this may achieve a short-term goal, in the long run it can lead to jamming the sacrum, which leads to low-back pain. Rolling out the thighs engages the lateral hip rotator muscles, one of which, the piriformis, originates via ligaments at the sacrum. If the piriformis spasms from overuse, the sacrum can no longer float in the sacroiliac joints and becomes fixed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 450.67px; height: 373.33px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image142.jpg" style="width: 450.67px; height: 373.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Dhanurasana</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;nine</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The subtle movements of the sacrum act as a pump, which stimulates the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the protective layers of the spinal cord. Our brain floats in cerebrospinal fluid, which is responsible for nourishing it and the spinal cord, as well as protecting it by acting as a shock absorber. Jamming the sacrum not only impairs vertebral motion (domino effect) but also inhibits the flow of vital cerebrospinal fluid. This creates difficulties for everything from doing the daily chores to engaging in the subtle work of meditation.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This tendency to turn out the feet and thighs is counteracted by medially rotating the femurs until a neutral position of the legs is found. Medial rotation of the femur is achieved by the tensor fascia latae, gracilis, semitendinosus and semimembranosus (two of the hamstrings), and the gluteus minimus muscles. With this leg position, the hip flexor muscles (rectus femoris and psoas) will be stretched, which is necessary for real progress in backbends. All four corners of the feet will then be equally anchored.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 410.67px; height: 500.00px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image30.jpg" style="width: 410.67px; height: 500.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.bbypsjxlxau4"><span class="c19 c0">FIGURE 18: SPINOUS PROCESSES</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Apart from providing a site for muscle attachments and acting as a lever for the spinal muscles that move the vertebrae, the spinous processes, along with the anterior longitudinal ligament, also prevent hyperextension of the vertebral column, thereby protecting the spinal cord. If we bend backward using the trunk extensors only, the back arch is soon obstructed by the spinous processes. And if the back arch is performed forcefully, back pain will ensue to communicate that the proper method is not being employed. This symptom is avoided by creating space between the spinous processes through engaging the rectus abdominis and pectoralis major.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 218.67px; height: 174.67px;"><img alt="image" src="images/image114.jpg" style="width: 218.67px; height: 174.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To open the chest we again need to prevent the compensation of the armpits turning out to the side. This is achieved through lateral rotation of the humerus, which is performed by the infraspinatus muscle.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Before animals walked upright, the spine was horizontal like a table, evenly supported on all four corners by four limbs. With an upright stance, the pelvic girdle, the thorax, and the shoulder girdle protect most of the spine not only from attackers but also from overzealous yoga students. One area that conspicuously lacks any protection, however, is the lumbar spine. Since the low back is the softest region, the novice will freely &ldquo;push&rdquo; into it, trying to &ldquo;conquer&rdquo; the backbend.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Instead, breathe into those areas that are tight, usually the chest and the front of the thighs, and soften and release them. Simultaneously, support those areas that are weak and soft. This is usually the low back, which needs to be protected by the firm corset of abdominal muscles (external and internal obliques, rectus and transverse abdominis). Additionally, the low back and neck already assume a natural lordotic curve (see figure 1, page 23), and overcontraction of these areas in backbends can lead to muscle spasm.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Similarly to the case of Upward Facing Dog, cultivate the support strength of the four pillars: your arms and legs. Once the torso is lifted into the backward arch, the work of the arms and legs conspires to lift the spine higher into the air, lengthening the trunk and alleviating any compression of the vertebrae. Imagine your trunk as a canopy billowing up, mounted on four strong and anchored supports. Protect the neck by lengthening rather than contracting it and releasing the crown of the head in the direction of the floor.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.o95zk6qxit6u"><span class="c19 c0">To Progress Deeper into Backbending:</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Once you have lifted into </span><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Dhanurasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and feel you have reached your limit, release some of the tension on those muscles that transported you into the posture and instead engage their antagonists. Around the shoulder girdle, this means releasing the trapezius and deltoideus muscles by engaging the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi. Along the trunk, release the erector spinae and quadratus lumborum by engaging the abdominals, especially rectus abdominis. At the hips, release the gluteus maximus by engaging the psoas and, in the legs, release the hamstrings by engaging the quadriceps.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This method of releasing the opposites is important for the following reasons:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; The back extensors contract and shorten the back. This is a useful action for transiting into </span><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Dhanurasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, but it has its limitations. Continued beyond the objective of arching the back, the movement pinches the spinous processes of the vertebrae together, which prevents any further backward movement.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; To create a deeper backbend, we therefore need to lengthen the spine and back. This action is performed by the rectus abdominis, psoas, and pectoralis major, all on the front of the torso.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; When pushing up into a backbend, the main muscles that are overcontracted are those in the low back, this being the softest area of the spine. The quadratus lumborum is released and lengthened by engaging the psoas and rectus abdominis.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; At the commencement of yoga practice, the rib cage of the practitioner often has a wooden and dormant quality. Yogic breathing and backbends help to make it soft and pulsating, ensuring healthy functioning of the vital organs in the thoracic cavity and increasing tidal volume &mdash; the amount of air exchanged during normal respiration. With engagement of the pectoralis major muscles, the chest awakens and will open.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.uy7wx8wj0ssm"><span class="c19 c0">How to Achieve These Movements:</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Maintain the support of those muscles that carried you into the posture (back extensors, shoulder flexors, hip extensors, and leg flexors) and then engage their antagonists to move deeper into the posture. To engage the pectoralis major in order to open the chest and armpits, make a swiping movement with your hands toward the end of the mat. This action brings the sternum toward the wrists or beyond, as the armpits and chest open.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Now, without compensating, walk your hands in toward your feet. Here engage the quadriceps as if you wanted to flex the hip joint. In this position, however, the hip joint cannot flex, as flexion is prevented by the hip extensor muscles. The quadriceps therefore deeply release and their work straightens the legs. Take up the space gained by bringing hands and feet closer together. Now come up onto the tips of your toes and lift your chest high above your shoulders. Keeping this newly gained height, lengthen your heels down to the floor again.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Engage your abdominal muscles now and use this contraction to lift the entire torso up to the ceiling. Engaging your abdominals will draw the spinous processes of the vertebrae apart. Deepen your backbend now by creating space underneath you.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Ensure throughout that the armpits, thighs, knees, and feet do not roll out. Take the stretch into the quadriceps and the rest of the front of the body.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Feel how the inhalations taken into the front of the chest and underneath the collarbones soften and open the rib cage. During the entire backbend the gaze is toward the nose. This </span><span class="c0 c7">drishti</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;helps to prevent overcontracting the neck. Rather than taking the head back to look down to your hands, drop the crown of the head and lengthen the back of the neck.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Engage the latissimus dorsi, which works together with the pectoralis major to extend the arms. The latissimus dorsi also has the capacity to depress the entire shoulder girdle (drawing the shoulder blades down the back). With this function it is the antagonist to the trapezius and levator scapulae muscles. By depressing the scapulae, the trapezius is released and the neck and upper back lengthen. The action of the latissimus dorsi together with the pectoralis major draws the spinous processes of the thoracic spine apart. This arches the chest and enables you to open behind the heart.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Yoga students are sometimes seen standing in </span><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;with a proudly swelled chest as if attending an army parade. The military attention posture consists of lifting and stretching the rib cage forward as character armor and fortification. This is achieved by hardening behind the heart, which gets us ready for combat. Anatomically this is done through contracting the trapezius and rhomboideus. The rhomboideus adducts the scapulae (pulls the shoulder blades in toward the spine).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In yoga the area behind the heart needs to stay as open as the sky. Closing off behind the heart makes us focus on what needs to be conquered in front of us. This is a function of the solar mind (related to Surya Nadi, the solar energy channel). In contrast, opening behind the heart allows us to see that we are right in the middle of everything: that everything just is and nothing needs to be conquered. This stance relates to suspended mind, which occurs when the breath enters the central channel, which is also called the heart, the devourer of mind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 300.00px; height: 370.67px;"><img alt="Image" src="images/image71.jpg" style="width: 300.00px; height: 370.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.7o6tw6pv42g8"><span class="c19 c0">FIGURE 19: PECTORALIS MAJOR</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The pectoralis major originates on the clavicle, the sternum, and part of the ribs close to the sternum. It inserts via a flat tendon at the front of the humerus. Its actions are complex. In the resting position, it flexes the humerus and draws it toward the midline. When the humerus is raised above shoulder level, the pectoralis major extends it. When the arm is raised out to the side, the pectoralis major draws it to the front (horizontal adduction). It can also perform adduction, abduction, and inward rotation, depending on the position of the arm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 150.67px; height: 122.67px;"><img alt="Image" src="images/image108.jpg" style="width: 150.67px; height: 122.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To stay open behind the heart in this particular posture we need to release the rhomboids by contracting their antagonist muscle, serratus anterior. Serratus anterior has widely fallen into disgrace and misuse. It is this muscle that sets the shoulder blades wide whenever weight is borne in the hands; it is therefore also a key muscle in Downward Dog and the arm balances. In all of these postures, the position of the shoulder blades needs to be depressed (latissimus dorsi) and abducted (serratus anterior).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The vigorous action of latissimus dorsi has a side effect, which is inward rotation of the humerus (arm bone). The &ldquo;lats&rdquo; share this effect with subscapularis and teres major. This medial rotation of the humerus lets the armpits flare out to the sides, an action that allows the shoulders to move up to the ears and ultimately decreases the backbend. This action needs to be counteracted by infraspinatus.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Caution:</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;The proper alignment of the armpits must be assessed by a qualified teacher. The action of outward rotation, if overdone, can lead to chronic inflammation of the shoulder joint, especially in the case of someone who already has permanently outwardly rotated humeri.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;Ten</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Exhaling slowly, come down.

If this is the case, press the heels of your hands together and allow the elbows to come apart.

Breathe slowly and keep the lower abdomen firm. Rapid breathing, especially into the abdomen, destabilizes all inversions. Keep your hands relaxed to the point that you can still wriggle your fingers. If the fingers are squeezed together in an attempt to hold the posture what often follows is that too much weight is placed on the elbows and the elbows are positioned too widely. To balance, press the wrists down into the ground and evenly distribute your body weight between the elbows and the hands.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Set the shoulder blades wide (abduction of the scapulae by serratus anterior &mdash; see </span><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Dhanurasana</span><span class="c0 c3">, page 111).

The center of gravity is much lower in </span><span class="c0 c7">Shirshasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;than when standing on one&rsquo;s feet, and therefore balancing is easier. The arms, elbows, head, and hands cover a much larger area than the feet, which potentially makes the posture steadier than standing upright.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Much was said in medieval Hatha scriptures about the capacity of the headstand and shoulder stand to &ldquo;conquer&rdquo; death and gain immortality. This is thought to happen in the following way: The subtle moon is situated in the body inside the head, precisely at the upper back of the soft palate. This is also the end of the </span><span class="c0 c7">sushumna</span><span class="c0">, called </span><span class="c0 c7">brahmarandhra</span><span class="c0">, the gate of Brahman. Anatomically this location is close to where the cranium joins the spine. From this &ldquo;moon&rdquo; the cooling nectar of immortality, called </span><span class="c0 c7">amrita</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0 c7">mrta</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;= death, </span><span class="c0 c7">a-mrta</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;= deathlessness), is thought to trickle down. This nectar is also utilized in other techniques such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Nabho</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">Kechari Mudra</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The subtle &ldquo;sun&rdquo; in the body is located in the stomach, where the gastric fire (</span><span class="c0 c7">agni</span><span class="c0">) is seated. The nectar of immortality exuded by the moon trickles down onto the sun, where it is consumed by its gastric fire. When the nectar is eventually exhausted, death is imminent. With the body inverted in space, the sun is placed above the moon. Gravity now inhibits the flow of </span><span class="c0 c7">amrita</span><span class="c0">, so that it can be reabsorbed. Immortality or extension of the life span was thought to be the result. The preoccupation with physical immortality is, however, a fairly recent development in yogic history. As Mircea Eliade has shown,21 it only gained momentum after 1000 CE. In the original yoga tradition, immortality was gained by realizing that which itself is deathless: the </span><span class="c0 c7">purusha</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(consciousness).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The identification with the body is called egoism. The body is a manifestation of our past experiences, including our hurts, ambitions, and limitations. Why would we endeavor to hold on to the bars of our prison cell forever, when we could be free? Why should we carry a huge anvil on our shoulder when we could spread our wings and fly? The body is a statement that &ldquo;I am separate from deep reality (Brahman),&rdquo; as Shankara has sufficiently demonstrated. According to the </span><span class="c0 c7">Samkhya Karika</span><span class="c0">, &ldquo;As a potter&rsquo;s wheel continues its movement even after the potter has ceased his effort, so the body will complete its natural course. Then after true knowledge is gained, no more physical manifestation will happen.&rdquo; The body is surrendered when the ocean of infinite consciousness is entered. This is yogic immortality. The ancient yoga has been taught in this way in the </span><span class="c0 c7">Upanishads</span><span class="c0 c3">, and by the great masters such as Kapila, Patanjali, Vyasa, and Shankara. Medieval attempts to seek freedom by the very thing that binds us are manifestations of the Kali Yuga.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 300.00px; height: 306.67px;"><img alt="Image" src="images/image60.jpg" style="width: 300.00px; height: 306.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Urdhva Dandasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;(see next page)</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 168.00px; height: 600.00px;"><img alt="Image" src="images/image38.jpg" style="width: 168.00px; height: 600.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 428.00px; height: 262.67px;"><img alt="Image" src="images/image169.jpg" style="width: 428.00px; height: 262.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Left, </span><span class="c0 c7">Shirshasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lift off; above, </span><span class="c0 c20 c7">Balasana</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Shirshasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a very useful posture for purifying the blood, the heart, and the lungs.

When asked this question, K. Pattabhi Jois quoted the </span><span class="c0 c7">Yoga Shastra</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;as saying, &ldquo;Right side first and left leg on top purifies liver and spleen. Left leg first and right leg on top is of no use at all.&rdquo; He also explained that the lotus done in this way stimulates insulin production.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Contemporary teachers have suggested performing </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on both sides to balance the body. Improving the symmetry of the body is achieved through the standing postures. However, the postures that strongly influence the abdominal and thoracic cavities, such as </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana, Kurmasana, Dvi Pada Shirshasana</span><span class="c0">, and </span><span class="c0 c7">Pashasana</span><span class="c0">, do not have the function of making the body symmetrical, but of accommodating the asymmetry of the abdominal and thoracic organs. To accommodate the fact that the liver is in the right side of the abdominal cavity and the spleen in the left, the right leg is first placed into position with the left leg on top. As leg-behind-the-head postures develop the chest, to place the left leg first in </span><span class="c0 c7">Kurmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;accommodates the fact that the heart is predominantly in the left side of the thoracic cavity.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Repeat these steps on the left, as if the right leg were still straight. First flex the knee joint completely until the underneath of the thigh touches the back of the leg over its entire length. Drawing the knee far out to the left, lift the left foot over the right ankle in toward the navel. Do not lift the left foot over the right knee, as this would mean opening the left knee joint, which would induce lateral movement into the knee during the transition.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Sitting in </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0">, inwardly rotate your femurs until the front edges of the tibias point downward and the soles and heels of the feet face upward. In this way the knee joints are completely closed and thereby protected. Do not sit in </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and retain the initial lateral rotation of the femurs used to enter the posture.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">With your left arm, reach around your back and take the big toe of the left foot with the palm facing downward. The foot that is on top is bound first. Now bind the right big toe with your right hand, placing the right arm on top of the left arm on your back. This is </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Padmasana.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;If you experience difficulty binding, cross the arms above the elbows rather than the forearms. This induces opening of the shoulders and the chest. A tight pectoralis minor muscle is the greatest obstacle here.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.9qj776eymrgj"><span class="c19 c0">YOGIC CONTEXT</span></h4><h5 class="c4 c12" id="h.melhsftzvlw3"><span class="c7">The Importance of</span><span class="c0 c20 c7">&nbsp;Baddha Padmasana</span></h5><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Padmasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a very potent meditation posture. In the scriptures it is suggested that the yogi prepare a seat from </span><span class="c0 c7">kusha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grass, place a deerskin or, better, a tiger skin over it, and a clean white cotton cloth on top. This set-up was suggested to me on several occasions during my studies in India. Such an elaborate meditation seat is used for the purpose of insulation. Energy always flows from the highest to the lowest potential. As the earth is receptive, the energy will flow from the body of the yogi into the ground. For this reason, insulation is suggested to preserve energy for the rising of </span><span class="c0 c7">kundalini</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c7">Mula Bandha</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is done for similar reasons. It prevents energy leaking out from the base of the spine.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The habit of yogis to meditate in the Himalayas must be seen in a similar light. The higher up into the mountains we go, the more the receptive pull of the earth decreases and the easier it is for</span><span class="c0 c7">kundalini</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to rise. We most readily lose energy from the palms of our hands and the soles of our feet. For this reason the soles are turned up away from the ground in </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0">. In </span><span class="c0 c7">Baddha Padmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;the hands are connected to the feet, and in this way an energy circuit is created. All energy is now recycled within the body, apart from the energy that leaves through the nine sensory gates (two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the generative organ, and the anus).</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 348.00px; height: 462.67px;"><img alt="Image" src="images/image161.jpg" style="width: 348.00px; height: 462.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c20 c7">Baddha Padmasana</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">If you still encounter difficulties binding, look at the following areas:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Hip rotation &mdash; the more we can inwardly rotate the femurs and bring the knees closer together, the more the feet will slide up into the groins. This brings the feet closer to the hands and thereby makes binding easier.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&bull; Shoulder flexibility &mdash; if the shoulders are freed up, we can more easily roll them back to reach for the toes.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">&bull; We need to wrap the arms around the waist. The thinner the waist, the easier the task. Shedding excess weight can work miracles here, as is the case in </span><span class="c0 c7">Kurmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Inhaling, lift the chest high, draw the shoulders back, and gaze upward.</span></p><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.pwmj06h4rfgh"><span class="c7">Vinyasa</span><span class="c14 c10 c7">&nbsp;Nine</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Exhaling, fold forward, placing the forehead on the floor, and gaze toward the nose.

It is preferred over the simple cross-legged position. In </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we sit on a solid base of sit bones, thighs, and knees. This enables us to retain the natural double-S curve of the spine as if we were standing upright in </span><span class="c0 c7">Samasthiti</span><span class="c0 c3">.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Not only is this correct positioning of the spine required for </span><span class="c0 c7">kundalini</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;to rise, it also promotes alertness. If we simply sit cross-legged, there is the tendency for the pelvis to tilt posteriorly, the heart to collapse, and the head to sink down toward the chest. Effort is required to avoid this slouching, which quickly leads to fatigue. If fatigue is present, meditation becomes difficult. Meditation is brightness and luminosity of the mind. If the mind is torpid during meditation, detrimental effects will result. (A more detailed discussion of meditation is given in part 4.)</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">To keep the mind alert, we need a posture in which the head can effortlessly be kept in line with the neck and the spine for an extended period of time. </span><span class="c0 c7">Padmasana</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;is the ideal posture for this purpose.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Drop the chin slightly.

The relaxation of the body is important for the assimilation of </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c7">Prana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;occurs in the atmosphere. Attempts have been made to compare </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to solar wind and alpha rays. The practice is most beneficial at sunrise and sunset, because pranic levels are then highest.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Only through accumulated </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is it possible to sustain the body for a long period of time. There are testimonies of yogis having been buried underground for up to a year and still being alive when disinterred. Although such feats are not the purpose of yoga, they are interesting in this context. Life is primarily sustained by </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0">, and the Ashtanga Vinyasa practice is designed to store it in the body. The </span><span class="c0 c7">Ujjayi</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;method turns the epiglottis into a valve, which increases the pranic pressure inside the body. The </span><span class="c0 c7">bandha</span><span class="c0">s work like filters that skim the </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from the air we breathe.

Through relaxation, the body, after it has been prepared through practice, becomes a receptive sponge that soaks it up. </span><span class="c0 c7">Shavasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is literally a bath in atmospheric </span><span class="c0 c7">prana</span><span class="c0 c3">. For this to happen we must let go completely.</span></p><h4 class="c4 c12" id="h.aphypjq16lu5"><span class="c19 c0">The Mental Importance of Relaxation</span></h4><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The posture is called </span><span class="c0 c7">Shavasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because it prepares us for death. It teaches us to completely surrender and let go. When the time comes to die, this ability to completely cease doing &mdash; to surrender totally &mdash; will enable us to abandon all identification with this body, this personality, and this ego. Then we can separate from this life as easily as a cucumber separates from the vine.26 Only the concepts we have of ourselves that cause us to desire some things and reject others, the I-am-ness, make us believe that this is our body. It is not ours at all. Have we created it? Even after centuries of scientific research we still cannot understand all aspects of the body, nor can we create a body. We have no certificate of ownership. When it is time to leave this world behind, we surrender this body back to nature (</span><span class="c0 c7">prakrti</span><span class="c0">). Our body is created by nature and not by us, as </span><span class="c0 c7">Yoga Sutra</span><span class="c0 c3">s IV.2 and IV.3 affirm.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">There is a Zen </span><span class="c0 c7">koan</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;that says:</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Butterfly takes off</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">To cross the lake</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">I come back to myself</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">There has been much deliberation concerning the meaning of this </span><span class="c0 c7">koan</span><span class="c0 c3">. One reading is to equate the butterfly with the thought. If we let go of it, if it leaves us to cross the lake, then we can return into the self. If we hold on to it, then we are one with the fluctuations of the mind (sutra I.4). If we let the butterfly take off then we can abide in our true nature (sutra I.3).</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">But the butterfly can also be equated to the body and the lake to the division between life and death. The body crosses this division; I do not. If I manage to let go of the body, then I will abide again in my true nature &mdash; the eternal, immutable consciousness. If I hold on, this return is not possible, and I will seek a new embodiment.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">In </span><span class="c0 c7">Shavasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;all effort, all determination, all will fall away from us. This falling away, this complete surrender, simulates the process that needs to occur at death. We can say that each </span><span class="c0 c7">Shavasana</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a preparation for the moment when not us but our corpse is doing the posture. Death may be frightening if we think we are the body. If we surrender, if we hand ourselves over, then it is an invitation to return to the true and natural state, which is consciousness. Following Lord Krishna&rsquo;s suggestion in </span><span class="c0 c7">Bhagavad Gita</span><span class="c0 c3">, we &ldquo;surrender the sense of agency, since only a fool believes himself to be the doer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The ancient masters taught that we are not the body, which is subject to death, but rather that we are the unborn, uncreated and unchanging. The death of the body invites us to come back to our true nature, which is consciousness. This letting go of artificial identification with what is impermanent is </span><span class="c0 c7">Shavasana. Shavasana</span><span class="c0">, when done properly &mdash; as the letting go of everything &mdash; shows us what we truly are. Both the </span><span class="c0 c7">Yoga Sutra</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c0 c7">Bhagavad Gita</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;state that the pure existence, pure awareness, pure being that is left at the end of the body is without beginning and end.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It cannot be cut by knives,</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It cannot be pierced by thorns,</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It cannot be burned by fire,</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It cannot be drowned in water.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">It is eternal, the true self.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c15 c12 c33" id="h.ddsk8j4fk5z6"><span class="c14 c10 c7"></span></h2><h2 class="c15 c12" id="h.6ashhwu47ha3"><span>Footnotes</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">1.

These could be further subdivided in the interests of greater precision, but for our present purposes that would involve us in too much detail. I am approaching this discussion from a historical perspective because it is one that Western readers can relate to. The four phases of yogic history I am calling &ldquo;naturalism,&rdquo; &ldquo;mysticism,&rdquo; &ldquo;philosophy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;technology.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.nsi3w8b040b"><span class="c25 c3">Phase One &mdash; Naturalism</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">At the dawn of time, people lived in harmony with themselves and nature. The average person had contact with the truth inherent in us, our divine nature. Religion or philosophy was not needed very much because people saw truth, beauty, and value within themselves and their surroundings.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The scriptures compiled in this age were called the Vedas, of which the most important is the Rig Veda. It comprises hymns in appreciation of life, the body we have been given, and the earth we live on. It is because people lived simple and natural lives that I call this age &ldquo;naturalism.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">During the age of naturalism most people used the mind like a muscle: you flexed it only when there was work to do. When there is no work for the mind, it is suspended (nirodha). At this time people naturally abided in their true nature.1 It is this suspension of mind that is characteristic of the phase of naturalism.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Over time, however, the harmonious period of naturalism began to decline: people lost contact with their true nature and simultaneously the power of the priestly caste increased.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">By the end of this vedic phase, religion had become no more than a stale establishment, and people had to pay the priests to sustain even some type of contentment.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.tqx9p8h5s4zo"><span class="c3 c25">Phase two &ndash; mysticism</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The second phase started when a great number of people turned their backs on society and went into the forest to search within themselves for the lost happiness. Most had lost the suspended mind (nirodha) and now had a single-pointed mind (ekagra chitta). The disadvantage of the single-pointed mind compared to the suspended mind is that it thinks constantly. However, in contrast to the predominant mind of today, it has the huge advantage of still being able to think about one subject until a clear solution is arrived at.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">During this phase there were many masters called rishis (seers) who had attained freedom through meditation, and many students gathered around them. In fact, if we believe various passages of theRamayana and Mahabharata, some of the forests were then as densely populated as the cities.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In this phase many could still quiet their minds by meditation. Often just listening to a teacher prompted people to awaken. The teachers living during this period were nirodhas, meaning they taught from a suspended mind. They offered a spontaneous insight into the nature of reality. It takes a student whose mind is at least single-pointed (ekagra) to spontaneously understand such a teacher. In other words the student needs to have a &ldquo;mature soul.&rdquo; I put this in quotation marks because the true self is eternally free and unchangeable. It does not increase or decrease in maturity.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The scriptures compiled in those days were the Upanishads, which are mystical dialogues between master and student. &ldquo;Upanishad&rdquo; means sitting near the master, while &ldquo;mysticism&rdquo; means that the hidden or the inexpressible is being expressed. The mere use of the word &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; indicates that we had largely lost the knowledge of our true nature by then, whereas in the vedic age, the age of naturalism, nothing was hidden. Gradually, the age of mysticism declined.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.9fhin62gfqbb"><span class="c25 c3">Phase Three &mdash; Philosophy</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">When the age of philosophy dawned, the majority of people had lost their ability to focus and now had a distracted mind (vikshipta chitta). A person with a distracted mind cannot understand a teacher with a suspended mind (nirodha chitta). The distracted mind, which is also called a confused or oscillating mind, needs a teacher with a single-pointed mind to explain systematically what has to be done. An individual with a distracted mind can no longer grasp truth spontaneously.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">One teacher who rose to the challenge was the Rishi Kapila, who created the first systematic philosophy of mankind, the Samkhya. Since the truth could not be found spontaneously anymore, it had to be reached in systematic steps. Kapila&rsquo;s great achievement was that he created a meditation system that guided students to freedom using a completely rational scientific method totally free of any religious influence. His appearance marked the beginning of the age or phase of philosophy.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">During this phase there appeared many great teachers who offered very different solutions. Although superficially at odds, all of the solutions or systems they offered were crystallizations of the one truth uttered by the rishis of the Upanishads. Most of the new schools of philosophy that emerged subsequently, such as Buddhism, Yoga, Vedanta, and Tantra, used the Samkhya of Kapila as a foundation and built on it.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Almost a thousand years after Kapila there came another great teacher, Patanjali. Very little is known about his life, but mythology offers us a story about him. Lord Shiva once gave a discourse on yoga to his consort, Uma. Because it was highly secret, a remote jungle location was chosen for the occasion. Shiva had just finished his discourse when he heard a noise in the shrubs. On investigation he found the thousand-headed serpent of infinity, Ananta, trying to get away. Shiva apprehended Ananta and told him that, as a punishment for secretly listening, he was sentenced to go to the humans and impart to them his new knowledge.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Setting out immediately on his new task, Ananta approached a village. As soon as they saw the thousand-headed serpent, some villagers ran away in horror while others started hurling stones at him. When Ananta went back to Lord Shiva and told him what had happened, Shiva explained that humans would be frightened by the appearance of a thousand-headed serpent, and suggested he take on human form. Following this advice, and having taken the name Patanjali, Ananta was readily accepted by humans. Because he is seen as a manifestation of the serpent of infinity, Patanjali is traditionally depicted as being half-human, half-snake.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Ananta himself is seen as the perfect yogi. One of his jobs is to provide a bed for Lord Vishnu. Vishnu can be incredibly heavy at times, so the bed needs to be very strong. At the same time, a very soft bed needs to be provided for the Lord. For this dual task, Ananta was very well suited, his coils being soft and strong simultaneously. In this way Ananta exemplifies the meaning of Yoga Sutra II.46, &ldquo;sthira sukham asanam&rdquo; &mdash; the posture needs the dual quality of firmness and softness.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Patanjali was not only the author of the Yoga Sutra, however. The Rishi Vyasa says, in a hymn praising Patanjali:</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Let us bow before the highest of all sages, Patanjali</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">who instructed on yoga to give clarity of mind who instructed on grammar to give clarity of speech</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">and who instructed on medicine to give health to the body.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Patanjali was also the author of the Mahabhasya, the great commentary on Panini&rsquo;s grammar. The Charaka Samhita, one of the principal treatises on Ayurveda, is also attributed to Patanjali.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Western scholars believe, however, that these three scriptures were written by three individuals, there being reason to believe they appeared in different centuries. The traditional view is that many of the great masters, such as Patanjali, were in fact siddhas or perfected beings who were either immortal or could manifest whenever they chose to. If we accept that Patanjali managed to transform himself from the thousand-headed serpent of infinity into a human being, it is not difficult to believe that he was able to manifest where and when he chose to.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Some time after Patanjali there came the next master in the lineage, Vyasa. He appears to have been immortal, since it cannot otherwise be explained how he could have produced such a vast body of writing. His birth name was Krishna Dvaipayana, but he is known as Veda Vyasa or just Vyasa. Veda Vyasa means &ldquo;the divider of the Veda.&rdquo; When at the beginning of the fourth age, the Kali Yuga, the memory of mankind had degenerated so much that nobody could memorize the vast entirety of the Veda, Vyasa divided it into four (Rig, Yajus, Sama, Atharva) and allocated the parts to different gotras or family lineages that were charged with protecting them. He is thus credited with preserving the Veda.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Vyasa is said to have created the 100,000 verses of the Mahabharata, the largest single piece of literature produced by humanity,2 as well as the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma Sutra, the most influential philosophical treatises in India today. He is believed also to have compiled the thirty-six Puranas, which consist mainly of mythological material.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The reason why Vyasa remains so important for us today is that he authored the authoritative commentary on the Yoga Sutra, the Yoga Bhasya. It has become so important that his commentary and theYoga Sutra together are regarded as one book. If it was not for Vyasa&rsquo;s commentary, the rather cryptic sutras of Patanjali could no longer be understood. In other words it is due to Vyasa that we know what Patanjali meant.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">All historical commentators who came after Vyasa, with the exception of King Bhoja, accepted his commentary and commented on it rather than on the Yoga Sutra directly. Vyasa was possibly the most important master in Indian history, and tradition ascribes to him divinity. It is said that he comes during every world age to restore ancient knowledge. Vyasa was an all-round genius, and we could call him the Leonardo Da Vinci of Indian philosophy.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Today, surprisingly enough, we find twentieth-century authors who write, in their interpretations of the Yoga Sutra, that they disagree with Vyasa or other ancient authorities. As modern-day practitioners we should allow ourselves to &ldquo;disagree&rdquo; with such towering intellectual and mystical giants only when we have risen to their state. Otherwise it will be difficult to reap the precious fruit of yoga.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Another important side of Vyasa that we have to understand is that he wrote authoritative texts on seemingly opposing schools of thought. He founded for example the philosophical school of Vedanta by compiling the Brahma Sutra, but he contributed to a rival school, that of Samkhya/Yoga by compiling the &ldquo;Commentary on the Yoga Sutra.&rdquo; Western scholars are very confused by the notion that one and the same person could write commentaries on opposing schools of thought, and they usually propose that there were two or more Vyasas. The truth is most Vedanta masters, such as Gaudapada, Shankara and Vachaspati Mishra, wrote commentaries on yoga &mdash; which, viewed superficially, is an opposing school of thought &mdash; while yoga masters provided commentaries on Vedanta. The reason for this is that all philosophical systems are only representations of the one truth taught in the Upanishads &mdash; they are versions of the truth but never the truth itself. A true mystic knows this. Although one might have a favorite system, he or she is still capable of realizing the truth in other systems and can make a contribution to them.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Scholars who have not had a mystical experience cannot understand this: they are still caught up in the game of right or wrong. According to the logic of consciousness, thesis (a certain position), antithesis (the opposing position), synthesis (the incorporation of both), and the negation of all these positions can be held simultaneously, since none of them can be true. Truth is only consciousness, which has no position and no right or wrong, but only awareness. If this is truly realized, the goal of yoga is reached.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The next teacher concludes the age of philosophy. His name is Adi Shankara, but he is often called Shankara Bhagavatpada (after his master), Govinda Bhagavatpada, or Shankaracharya, the last of these meaning the teacher Shankara. He founded four monasteries whose abbots still carry the title Shankaracharya today. Some scriptures that are attributed to Shankara were actually written by abbots; nevertheless, he did leave behind a vast body of writings.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Shankara was a true genius. When he was twelve, his master assigned him the task of writing commentaries on the principal Upanishads, and they remain authoritative. His main work is the Brahma Sutra Bhasya, a commentary on the Brahma Sutra. Today he is mainly known as a teacher of Advaita Vedanta, which was his chief subject.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">Shankara&rsquo;s great contribution to yoga is his commentary on Vyasa&rsquo;s commentary on Patanjali&rsquo;s Yoga Sutra, called Vivarana.3 One of the best descriptions of Yoga philosophy, it is a worthy expression of Shankara&rsquo;s genius. With him the age of philosophy drew to a close, and the world experienced an even further decline.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.9oy8q6ft2cuh"><span class="c25 c3">Phase Four &mdash; Technology</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">While most people in the age of naturalism had a suspended mind (nirodha chitta), in the age of mysticism a single-pointed mind (ekagra chitta), and in the age of philosophy a distracted mind (vikshipta chitta), the average person in the last age has an infatuated mind (mudha chitta).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;Infatuated&rdquo; here means obsessed with one&rsquo;s own body, wealth, appearance, and family relations. Connected to these are materialism and vanity. Important here is that the infatuated mind identifies with the body. Materialism is the philosophy that reduces human beings to their bodies. Obsession with wealth results from preoccupation with the whims of the body, while vanity is preoccupation with one&rsquo;s external appearance. Obsession with family relations means relating more to people who share one&rsquo;s gene pool.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This last phase is called the age of technology. The Sanskrit word tantra means &ldquo;technique.&rdquo; Since philosophy and, to a greater extent, mysticism and naturalism now went right over people&rsquo;s heads, the new types of teaching were concerned only with techniques: how one does things.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The scriptures of this age, which describe mainly technique and do not emphasize philosophy, are called tantras, and there are between seven and eight hundred of them. Westerners know the tantras mostly for their excursions into explicit sexual technique, but to reduce the tantras to those rare passages does not do them justice. It does show us, however, how the infatuated Western mind works. Most yogic treatises written after Shankara, such as the Shiva Sutra, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Shiva Samhita, and the Gheranda Samhita, to name but a few, are in fact tantras.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The philosophical school of yoga was maintained during the age of technique by a number of masters. Vachaspati Mishra, who commented on Vyasa&rsquo;s commentary and all other traditional systems of philosophy, made outstanding contributions in the tenth century. Vijnanabhikshu, who also commented on Samkhya and Vedanta, wrote one of the most important commentaries, the Yoga Vartikka, in the fifteenth century. The most recent of the important contributions is the excellent commentary on Vyasa&rsquo;s commentary written by Hariharananda Aranya in the twentieth century. All of these writings have been consulted in preparing the present text.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.1ja73bncsq5v"><span class="c25 c3">The Importance of the Four Ages for Today&rsquo;s Practitioner</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">According to the Puranas, humanity started out in the golden age (the vedic age) and, through progressive ages of degeneration, we are now in the dark age (Kali Yuga). If we look at the development of yogic scriptures we can recognize these stages.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In the golden age people had a suspended mind (nirodha chitta), which means they thought only when necessary and at other times abided in the heart, the divine source. In the second age, people had single-pointed minds (ekagra chitta) and, through a few instructions given by a master who had a suspended mind himself, they could return to the source. In the third age people&rsquo;s minds shifted down into a confused state (vikshipta chitta). The masters who taught in this period worked on getting individuals back into the single-pointed state. In the fourth age, the period we live in now, people&rsquo;s minds have degenerated into the infatuated, materialistic state (mudha chitta). Teachers today first have to teach that there is an eternal, immortal sacred core to us, which the confused mind is still able to remember but the infatuated mind has forgotten.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">For the study of philosophy this means that we must first understand what was taught by teachers who also lived like us, in the age of the infatuated mind. They include Vachaspati Mishra, Vijnanabhikshu, and Hariharananda Aranya. With this understanding, we unlock the teachings of the masters of the age of philosophy (= confused mind) like Patanjali, Vyasa, and Shankara. After internalizing these, we can understand even earlier teachers like Yajnavalkya, Vasishta, and Kapila (single-pointed mind). If we understand their simple message of the heart we have arrived home at the suspended mind, where our true nature is recognized.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h3 class="c24 c12" id="h.ywmkyhrechht"><span class="c25 c3">Involution Versus Evolution</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">We can say that, on an individual level, the yogi has to reverse the historical development that the human race has undergone. Similarly we can say the yogi has to reverse the movement of evolution of the universe on an individual level. The philosophy of Samkhya describes the process of evolution of the world as a down-and-out movement. Evolution here starts with the highest and most subtle, the state before the Big Bang (prakrti).</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">This source of nature evolves into intelligence. From intelligence comes ego. From ego comes space. From space comes air. From air comes fire, from fire comes water, and from water comes earth. Each evolute becomes coarser and grosser than the previous, subtler one.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">In the human body these steps are represented through the chakras, with pure intelligence referring to the Sahasrara chakra, pure I-am-ness or ego to the Ajna chakra, space to the Vishuddha chakra, air to the Anahatta chakra, fire to the Manipura chakra, and water to the Svadhisthana chakra. Finally the element earth is represented through the lowest chakra, the Muladhara. This whole process is called evolution, but it comes with a degeneration of awareness. When the Muladhara is reached, the world is manifest and self-knowledge is lost. This movement of evolution is directed downward and outward.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c3">The yogic process of involution reverses this to an in-and-up movement. We go in and up through the chakras of earth, water, fire, air, and space, and then reabsorb ego into intelligence and intelligence into its origin, prakrti (nature). Then we abide in the pristine state of consciousness and awareness, which is the state of freedom and ecstasy.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><h1 class="c18 c12" id="h.8b9zo0yz8ozv"><span>Images</span></h1><hr><p class="c4 c31"><span class="c16 c20 c10 c7"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c16 c10 c7">Samasthiti</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden;
